Some run better in calmer seas and some run better in rough. In West Palm Beach, flat and chugger heads are used to cut the water and run straight on rough days. Chugger heads are used to leave a big bubble trail behind. Bullet head style lures are most effective on calm days.

Anglers for the most part drift along our ledge that goes from 90� to 150� sharply. This ledge provides a habitat for all types of fish to live, congregate and feed from. The current in West Palm Beach runs from south to north and makes it easy to just drift along the ledge only having to make small adjustments from wind and tide. Drift Fishing is also a great way to catch some of the best eating fish in West Palm Beach while relaxing waiting for the bite. Drift fishing is not exclusively bottom fishing, anglers will keep a line on top of the water or use a kite if the wind is favorable for it. Pelagics regularly cruise around the ledge for an easy meal. ",What will I catch drift fishing in West Palm Beach?,"There are many types of fish that you will have a chance of catching while drift fishing in West Palm Beach. The main target of drift fishing anglers are the bottom dwelling species such as Snapper (Mutton), Snapper (Yellowtail) and Porgies to name a few. However, you will have a chance at catching Tuna (Blackfin), Dolphin (Mahi Mahi), King Mackerel (Kingfish), Sailfish, Wahoo and Cobia. While these fish are favorite target of anglers drift fishing in West Palm Beach, there are many other types you many encounter as well. Grunts, Triggerfish, Blueline Tilefish, Rainbow Runner and sharks are also present all year round in the area.",Angler Advisor Pro Tips for Drift Fishing in West Palm Beach,"To maximize your chances at catching multiple species, you need to plan ahead before you begin your drift fishing trip in West Palm Beach. Begin by planning a drift route. The current runs south to north in West Palm Beach and at times can move briskly, you will want to begin your drift south of your inlet to minimize your run back at the end of the day. There are 3 key setups you will need to have as you will be targeting 3 different zones of the water column West Palm Beach. A good bottom drift fishing setup that consist of a star drag reel, like a Shimano Torium, matched with a medium heavy rod, like a Shimano Grappler. You will be holding the bottom drift fishing setup mostly and want a lightweight setup to reduce fatigue. Then you will need a setup that can handle big powerful initial runs. This setup will be used to keep a bait about halfway through the water column and you will want a piece of single strand wire on it as King Mackerel and Wahoo cruise this area. Finally, you are going to want a setup for your bait on top in West Palm Beach. This rod need to have a fast or less action tip as this will help you should a Sailfish or Mahi take your bait as they are aerobatic and the extra flex in the tip will reduce the chance of them throwing the hook when jumping.

When you look at a map of Florida, you will notice that the West Palm Beach area juts out to the east. Then as you look at the topography of the sea floor off of West Palm Beach, you will see that there is a sharp drop off followed by a continual sloping. Finally, the Gulf Stream, that supplies nutrients to all marine life, can come within 7 miles of shore. As there is a sharp ledge, deep water close to shore and the Gulf Stream feeding all of it, it translates to some of the best deep sea fishing in the world and all inside of 10 miles from shore.",What does this mean to you as an angler Deep Sea Fishing in West Palm Beach? ,The short version is the variety of fish you can catch while deep sea fishing close to shore in West Palm Beach is immense. You may be anchored up fishing for Snapper (Yellowtail) on the reef in 60� of water and a 50lb Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) will cruise by your boat. Or you may be trolling for Mahi and a Blue Marlin will hit your lines. You need to be prepared for a multitude of species that you may encounter during a normal day of deep sea fishing. The other factor that you will need to understand is the fish in West Palm Beach are constantly on the move. The Mahi may be biting in 200� one day and 800� the next. The Snapper (Muttons) may be chewing well in 80� on top of the ledge in the morning and then 150� on the bottom of the ledge the next day. This is all a part of the allure of deep sea fishing in West Palm Beach and why so many anglers consider this a top deep sea fishing destination.,Key Points to Remember before going Deep Sea Fishing,"The most important thing to remember is you are going to need multiple setups to have a shot at the diversity of fish that you may encounter while Deep Sea Fishing in West Palm Beach. Anglers will have a mix of conventional trolling setups in various sizes, a mix of spinning setups in various sizes, a couple bottom fishing star drag setups and an electric reel used for kites and deep dropping. This may seem like an overwhelming list of just rods and reels for deep sea fishing and that is why it is important to visit an Angler Advisor in West Palm Beach that will take the time to understand your needs and guide you to the setups that are truly tailored to your fishing goals when deep sea fishing. It is very easy to be oversold or buy on impulse and experienced anglers know this can lead to buyers regret. Deep Sea Fishing can truly be an exhilarating experience if you are prepared when you get on the water in West Palm Beach. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There are some great benefits to bottom fishing. First off you use a lot less fuel than trolling or running and gunning for fish. You only need a few good rod and reel setups to get tight while bottom fishing in West Palm Beach. The bait rigs you will use are also inexpensive and will not break the bank if you lose a few of them. Bottom fishing is also very relaxing, you can put on the music sit back and wait for the bite. The other great thing about Bottom Fishing in West Palm Beach is that it is great for novice and experienced anglers. If you have friends and family that may not be used to fishing, this would be a perfect way to get them on some fish. ",What tackle do I need to be successful Bottom Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"The most important part of your bottom fishing tackle in West Palm Beach is going to be your Rod and Reel. For your reel you are going to want one that is lightweight, has a star drag and is designed for braided line. The star drag is important as it allows you to quickly put the reel in free spool and get your bait down. Once you bait is at the desired depth, all you must do is flip the spool release back and your reel is right back to your preset drag. Star drags also allow you to make small drag adjustments when fighting a fish. There are 2 parts of the rod that will make a huge difference when bottom fishing in West Palm Beach. The weight rating of the blank needs to be at least a medium heavy as this is the lever point of the rod that will help you turn the fishes head and help you bring it up to the boat. Then you will want a tip action of fast to medium fast as this will allow you to feel the bite best while not being overpowered by the weight of your rig. Your rig can vary when bottom fishing in West Palm Beach, but you should start with a high low rig and use as little weight as possible to hold bottom.",Angler Advisor tips for Bottom Fishing in West Palm Beach,"The great thing about bottom fishing in West Palm Beach is that it is somewhat forgiving so a small mistake most likely will not cost you a fish. First you want to get used to the feel of the weight you are using and when it is on the bottom. Start out with a 3oz weight and work your way up if it does not hold bottom. When you let your line out, you want to let it out briskly until you feel the weight hit the bottom. Once you hit the bottom, let it out just a little bit more to compensate for the drift. If you are not getting bites while bottom fishing like this, step up your weight in 1oz increments until you are confident that you are holding close to the bottom. You do not want to use too heavy of a weight in West Palm Beach, as the more weight you have will affect your ability to feel the bite. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Since the gulfstream comes so close to shore and with West Palm Beach being just above the sub tropic zone, many fish species call the waters home. Most sperafishers will be target snapper and groupers. Snappers can vary from Yellowtail, Mutton, Mangrove and the big Cubera�s. Grouper are mainly only taken by spearfishing in West Palm Beach and you will find Black, Gag and Red grouper plentiful in the area. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The West Palm Beach area is considered to be mainly a live bait fishery, meaning that most trophy fish are taken while using live bait. Kite fishing is only done with live baits. You will fly a specialized kite that has 2-3 release clips (similar to what is on an outrigger) on it from a short kite rod with an electric reel. Your actual fishing lines with hang from each of these release clips. When a fish gets tight, your line will release from the clips and you can fight the fish. One of the less talked about benefits of Kite Fishing in West Palm Beach is that you do not have to clear all of your lines when a fish is on as your lines are up in the air.",What tackle do I need to go Kite Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"There are several tackle needs you will want to have before going kite fishing in West Palm Beach. First and most obvious, you will need a fishing Kite. You will want 3 different kites, one for low wind, one for high wind and one all purpose kites. Then you will need a way to bring the kite in and out as you change lines or move. While you can hand crank a kite in, it is not recommended, and you will fatigue quickly doing it this way. You want to have a short kite fishing rod and an electric reel. Then you will want a kite rigging kit in West Palm Beach that includes all the rings, needles, hooks, markers, helium balloons etc. that are necessary for a successful day of kite fishing. Finally, you need to have a reel that can pick up line quickly and has a low drag setting, like a Shimano Talica BFC (designed specifically for Kite Fishing).",Angler Advisor Tips for Kite Fishing in West Palm Beach,"Kite Fishing in West Palm Beach is on of the most visually exciting types of fishing, but you have to be prepared to be successful. You will be actively working the rods as your bait will be moving up and down with the kite as the wind fluctuates. Using a trident style rod holder that fits into a single rod holder on your boat is a game changer when kite fishing in West Palm Beach. This allows you to have your both of your rods and your kite line at your fingertips so that you can instantly make changes to any part of your entire kite fishing setup. You want to keep your bait as close to the surface as possible without allowing the bait to come out of the water. Allowing your bait to fly out of the water repeatedly or often can stress the bait.

There are many types of jigging styles anglers employ. Anglers bottom fishing in West Palm Beach like to use a jig that flat falls or flutters on the bottom. If you are looking for a reactionary bite and the fish could be anywhere within the water column then you will be using a speed jig. When the fish are working baits on the surface then you will be jigging with a jig that can be effective when worked horizontally. Whichever jig type you are using or type of jigging, you want to make sure that your rod and reel setup are the correct action so that your jig has the best presentation possible.",What are the different types of jigging in West Palm Beach?,"While there are all types of jigging, there are 4 main styles of jigging that are used by anglers in West Palm Beach. Bottom jigging is the most popular and by far the easiest type. Bottom jigging uses a butterfly style jig and is bounced along the bottom as you drift. Speed jigging is the next in popularity. For speed jigging in West Palm Beach, you are using along jig and pulling it through the water column as fast as possible to get a reactionary bite. Then there is horizontal jigging which is using jig that you can work just under the waters surface. Finally, the newest type, which is also gaining in popularity, is slow pitch jigging. Slow pitch jigging uses specialized rods, reels and jigs that allow you to fish at great depths in West Palm Beach while reducing fatigue as the rod does all the work for you. ",What type of jigging should I be doing for my target species?,"Choosing the correct jigging type in West Palm Beach depends on where your target species hunts for food in the water column and the depth it is usually found. If you want to target Snapper (Mutton), which are mainly in 80�-150� and hang around the bottom in West Palm Beach, so using a butterfly style bottom jig is best as your are constantly working the feeding and living zone. If you are hunting for tuna and kings in West Palm Beach, then you want to work the whole water column and use a speed jig to get a reactionary bite from the pelagics. When hunting for grouper and tilefish you want to use a slow pitch jigging setup. When you come across a school of Mahi then you want to use a sub-surface jig. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Anglers will have success popping fishing inshore, offshore and surf fishing. Popping is a successful technique because it mimics a baitfish jumping out of the water fleeing from a predator. Other predatory fish keen in on this sound and sight then go after it thinking there is an easy meal close by. When a fish does hit your popper in West Palm Beach, it is an explosive bite.  Be ready when that bite comes as well as many times the fish will explode out of the water to attempt and shake the hook loose.",What types of lures will I be using for Popping Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"When talking about popping fishing in West Palm Beach, the image that comes to anglers� minds are big ole lure with a big cupped face. Popping fishing encompasses so much more than just those types of lures. One that does not get enough credit is the popping cork that is fish with either a lure or live shrimp underneath it. You will pop the cork to mimic a feeding predator drawing other fish in to investigate. One of the top producing popping fishing lures in West Palm Beach is the top water plug. These plugs get worked in a walk the dog style by twitching your rod tip as you are reeling in. Traditional popping lures with a cupped face are used mainly offshore in schools of big tuna and Dolphin (Mahi Mahi).",What types of fish will I catch when popping fishing in West Palm Beach?,"You will have a shot at catching all predatory fish in West Palm Beach that feed on bait in the top of the water column while popping fishing. Snook are the main target of popping fishing in the West Palm Beach area. Mainly you will be using top water plugs but popping corks with a Vudu Shrimp or Live shrimp can be deadly as well. Big jacks love popping lures, they cruise in schools and the competition for food can be fierce, so when they hear what they think could be an easy meal, they are quick to bite. Finnicky schooling Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) can be fired up by popping fishing. Work the plug quicky and the Mahi will chase it causing the school to also fire up. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Unlike freshwater fishing or extremely light tackle inshore fishing, you will be throwing larger lures and baits. The benefit to using a spinning setup is the overall ease of use. Anglers also like the benefit of reeling with their less dominate hand and using their dominate arm on the pole to fight the fish in West Palm Beach. Unlike it bait caster counterparts, spinning reels will not backlash on you. All you have to do is open the bail on a spinning reel and cast out your favorite lure or bait. ",When will I be spinning fishing in West Palm Beach?,"There are many scenarios where you will be spinning fishing in West Palm Beach. For anglers that enjoy surf fishing, a spinning setup on a long rod is ideal for casting bait to the schools of Snook, Jack Crevalle and Tarpon that prowl the surf. When out Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) fishing, having a few spinning setups ready to pitch at the school is always recommended and can be put in the hands of a novice and experienced angler. For the inshore anglers in West Palm Beach, having a spinning setup that is designed for long and accurate cast can be a game changer when targeting fish in the backwaters.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Trolling allows anglers to cover a great amount of water quickly and sub surface depths. There are many styles of lures and baits that can be used when trolling in West Palm Beach and each has its own unique presentation to entice bites. Trolling can be one line or 10 depending on the size of your boat and the experience level of the crew fishing with you. If you want to find out what is biting right now in West Palm Beach, put out a mixed spread and troll around any area that looks different. Vary your trolling speed when not bites as the fish may hit faster moving baits some days and slower ones another.",Understanding various trolling lures head styles in West Palm Beach," It can get overwhelming quickly deciding what lures to put in your spread when trolling in West Palm Beach. The first thing you want to know is how different lures perform based on their head style. Trolling lures with a bullet style head (point in the front) are best used on calm days as they run straight sub-surface. Flat head lure are good for both calm days and rough days. Flat head lures will leave a large bubble trail and because the head is flat, it grips the water when being trolled, where as a bullet head would jump out of the water in rough conditions in West Palm Beach. Cupped nose trolling lures grip the water the best and move around less than a flat head lure. You will want to use these on rough days. There are many variations to all these lures like slant heads and jet heads. If you are just starting out trolling in West Palm Beach, you want to start with flat head lure heads as these will track best without you having to adjust it. ",What lures should be in my trolling spread in West Palm Beach?," The number one question our Angler Advisor�s get is what lures should be in my trolling spread? While this answer can vary greatly depending on time of year, species you are targeting and who you ask� there is a simple tried and true answer. 2 Out 1 Back 1 Down!! What does that mean to you when trolling in West Palm Beach? 2 Out � This is going to be either your outrigger lines or if you do not have outriggers, the two lines in front of your corner rods. You want to run a Ilander skirted ballyhoo on one line and a trolling lure on the other like a Boone Dorado Cather. These two will be just outside of your prop wash and will run just under the surface, broaching the surface at times. 1 Back � This is your tuna lure and you want to have either a cedar plug or a small Williamson Flash Feather. This lure needs to be way way way way back in clean water with no bubbles or foam from the boat wash. 1 Down � run a diving plug that will run 10�-20� below the surface like a Yo-Zuri High Speed Vibe. It is also a good idea to use a heavy mono leader with this as the toothy creatures will most likely hit this trolling lure in West Palm Beach. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is hard to truly appreciate an expensive reel until you catch your first fish with it. Expensive reels will pay for themselves as they will last 5-10 years if properly maintained. ,charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,Choosing the best West Palm Beach spinning reel ,"Choosing the best spinning reel for West Palm Beach largely comes down to the size of fish you want to catch and the size line you will be fishing with. Determine the size line you will need to catch the fish you want in West Palm Beach. There are applications for just about every sized spinning reel in West Palm Beach, the important part is that you make sure to buy quality equipment that can hold up to the fish and saltwater environment. There are plenty of giant fish to catch in West Palm Beach along with an abundance of sharks that want to steal your catch. It is important to have a quality spinning reel that is durable and powerful enough to pull your catch away from the sharks, turn the head on a giant tarpon, winch in a big wahoo at high speed, or pull a 40 inch snook away from the thick structure.",When to use a conventional reel vs a spinning reel in West Palm Beach,"There are many applications to use a convention reel vs a spinning reel (and vise versa) when fishing in West Palm Beach. For trolling, you always want to use a conventional setup, however for casting at fish like Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) or King Mackerel (Kingfish), a spinner is the way to go. Vertical jigging in West Palm Beach can go either way, conventional reel will eliminate the hassle of opening and closing the bail to re-drop. Anglers prefer a conventional reel for bottom fishing because it allows you to easily let more line out as your boat drifts, versus flipping the bail. When fishing on top of bridges and piers for snook, a low profile conventional reel setup is preferred because the line is on top of the rod and it will never touch the railing when fighting a fish. A spinning reel is preferred anytime you are fishing in West Palm Beach with artificial lures because spinning reels generally have a lower gear ratio which allows you to sweep bottom and present your lure better. What is the best fishing reel for beginners? Spinning Reels are going to be the best choice fo beginners as it is easy to use and will not backlash like conventional reels.",Cleaning your reel after a day of West Palm Beach fishing,"Properly cleaning your reel after a day of fishing in West Palm Beach should be a part of every anglers routine. First, lock the drag down to full, which seals the gaps in the drag washers. Then, LIGHTLY spray the reels down with fresh water on the shower setting. On West Palm Beach offshore setups, wash the reel bodies and rods with some boat soap and a mitt. Then hose the soap off and shammy the reels dry. After cleaning your reels, don�t forget to loosen the drags all the way back down once they are dry. For West Palm Beach inshore fishing setups, hose them dry then spray some Reel Cleaner on the body of the reel. Let it sit for about five minutes after cleaning your reel, then hose it down and loosen the drag.  ",How do you know what size spinning reel to buy?,"Choosing what size spinning reel to buy in West Palm Beach largely depends on the species of fish you desire to catch. Determining what sized line you will be fishing with will help tell you what sized reel is right for you. For Offshore fishing, an 8000-1000 sized spinning reel will get the job done for jigging and casting to pelagic species like mahi, blackfin tuna, wahoo and kingfish. If you�re into light tackle, a 4000-5000 sized spinning reel is great for pitching to mahi on the weedlines. If you are bottom fishing, an 8000 sized spinning reel will be a perfect match for you. For some of the smaller inshore species like pompano, Spanish mackerel and snapper, a light 3000 sized spinning reel works best. When chasing after the snook and tarpon in West Palm Beach, you will need to begin beefing up your tackle. For snook, you want a reel that holds around 300 yards of 30-pound braided line and about 20 pounds of drag. Anything 6000 sized and up will work. For Tarpon, your spinning reel should hold around 500 yards of 30-pound braid. An 8000-14000 sized reel will give you a good advantage. 15-20# braid -3000-5000 20-40#-braid 5000-8000 40-65#-8000-14000 80# braid 10000+",What is the best reel for beach fishing?,You want to use a spinning reel for its ease of use and versatility. The two best reels for beach fishing are the Shimano Twin Power and Shimano Saragosa SW.,What reel should I use for bottom fishing?,"Use a conventional reel for bottom fishing. Most anglers prefer a star drag reel for precise on the fly drag adjustments. Many of these reels are offered in both high and low gear ratios. A higher gear ratio will give you more line per crank, but less torque, leverage and stopping power and is good for high speed jigging and pulling your catch away from all the sharks. A lower gear ratio gives you considerably less line retrieve per crank, but much more torque, leverage and turning power. This is best for catching really big fish or slow pitch jigging. Bottom fishing specific reels have a �spool lock� on the side instead of a clicker which allows you to break off instantly and easily instead of tightening the drag or thumbing the spool to break off your snag. It is extremely useful!",What is the best brand fishing reel?,"Shimano has the best reels on the market because of their cutting edge technologies. The best fishing reels are:imano Stella Spinning ReelShimano Tiagra Conventional ReelShimano Stradic Inshore Spinning ReelShimano Beastmaster 9000a Electric Reel",What Reel should I use for kite fishing?,"The right reel to use for kite fishing is a lever drag conventional reel with a high gear ratio. The lever drag allows you to adjust the drag quickly, which is essential when setting hook or dropping back to a fish on a kite. You need a fast reel that brings in a lot of line per crank because you will need to pick up a lot of slack line quick to come tight on the bite. The Shimano Talica BFC is made especially for this purpose and is the best reel to use for kite fishing in West Palm Beach. Another great reel to use for kite fishing is the Shimano Speedmaster II because they are extremely fast and lightweight. A light weight, compact reel is important when it comes to kite fishing because you want your entire setup to be lightweight and easy to maneuver around the boat. ",What are electric reels used for in West Palm Beach?,"There are a few applications where electrics are used in West Palm Beach. The first and most common is kite fishing. You will need an electric reel to raise and lower your kite which allows you to present live baits right on the surface in the most subtle way possible. Another application you will need an electric reel for is deep dropping. There are countless delicious species of fish to catch on the bottom reefs and wrecks. Many of which are found in over 1000 feet of water. Electric reels are used to quickly and conveniently drop and retrieve your heavy bottom fishing or swordfish weights/rigs in deep water. The final application electric reels are used for in West Palm Beach is high speed wahoo trolling, this is not necessary, or very common, but it is the preferred method for some of the serious wahoo fishermen because of how easily the fish are pulled in at such high speed and heavy drag.",How do you match a rod and reel?,"The best way to match a rod and reel in West Palm Beach is to first select the reel you will want to use. Once you have that, there will be suggested line strength to use with that reel. Next you wil want to look at rods that have that have the same line strength range. ",How to use a reel for trolling when deep sea fishing in West Palm Beach,"Reels for trolling in West Palm Beach are generally lever drag conventional reels. The higher up the lever is, the more drag is engaged. There is a stop at �strike� where, when the drag is set properly, the reel should be left at while trolling. If you press in the stop, you can now bring the lever past strike and into �full.� Only go into full drag if you�ve hooked too big a fish to fight in strike. Most reels for trolling in West Palm Beach are also two speed, meaning they have a high and low gear ratio. Press the button on the side of the handle to drop into low gear which gives you better cranking power and leverage, but less line per crank. There is a switch directly underneath the button that allows you to switch back into high gear.",,

One suggestion that tends to work well for a number of types of fishing will have similar specifications to this:   6'6""- 7'. Fast action, heavy power, 50-100# line rating.  However, there are many factors to determine which rod will be best for you.  Come speak to our professional Angler Advisors and they can assist you in the decision making process.",charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,Choosing the best rod for fishing in West Palm Beach,"How do I choose a Saltwater rod in West Palm Beach? What is the best rod for saltwater fishing? Determine the type of fishing you will be doing to then match up an appropriate rod. You will need different rods for trolling, casting, pitching, jigging or bottom fishing in West Palm Beach. Take length, weight of line and fishing application into account when choosing the best rod. Generally, trolling rods are shorter, stouter rods for pulling baits and gaining leverage on the fish. 5�6�- 7� with a moderate action is perfect for trolling. Make sure your boat rods have a gimbal butt to lock into the rod holder. For casting, stay around the 7�-7�6 range with a fast action. If you are casting from shore you can bump up to an 8 or 9 foot rod for extra distance. Jigging rods are usually shorter ranging from 5�-6�6� and have a parabolic bend for working a vertical jig. Make sure to match up the line and lure rating on the rod to the tackle you plan on fishing to make sure you are fishing the best rod for the fishing you are doing in West Palm Beach.",Choosing a rod for fishing off of West Palm Beach,"A 30 class rod is great for dragging baits in West Palm Beach. Choose a stout, short rod that has a gimbal butt so it locks into the rod holder. 5'6-6'6 is the right lenth rod for it in West Palm Beach. Some of the anglers fishing on center consoles prefer bumping up to a 7' rod to reach around the outboard engines better. Roller Guide rods are used for trolling with heavy monofilament, but ring guides are just fine if you fish braided line or braid backing. A rating of 30-50 is a pefect rod for Trolling in West Palm Beach. The exception is high speed wahoo trolling. You want to choose a bent butt rod with roller guides and a rating upwards of 80-130 to pull in the wahoo.Choosing a rod for bottom fishing in west palm beach can be tricky. You want a rod around 7� with a fast tip and stout backbone to allow for a more positive hookset and strong backbone for turning power. A fast rod tip is what creates a sensitive rod, which is important for fishing in West Palm beach because you must be able to feel your bait, the bottom and a bite with ease. Look for a rod that has some play in the tip section around the top three guides when bent. Then, bend the rod again and look down the blank, after the tip section, the rod should stop bending, which is where you get your backbone and turning power from. It�s important to choose a powerful rod for fishing in West Palm Beach because not only are there giant fish hanging out on the reefs and wrecks, there is an abundance of sharks that know exactly what is going on and are waiting to steal your catch.  ",Rod Action and power explained,"Rod Action and power can be an overwhelming choice when selecting a rod for any type of fishing. However, if you break it down to the basics, you can easily make an informed decision. Combining the two is a balancing act.Rod Action is the the ""action"" from the recoil of the rod tip after it bends. More of the rod bends and recoils slower with slower action rods. Fast action rods recoil quickly as less of the rod tip bends. When you cast out a topwater plug, a slow action rod will cause the lure to have a  slower and more exagerated movement as a larger portion of the top of the rod  bends. Because a large portion of the top of the rod bends, it recoils slower absorbing the force caused by pulling on the lure. On the other side of that, a fast action tip will quickly and abruptly move the lure. Rod action also refers to the amount of ""action"" (or movement) left in the rod tip after a constant weight is applied (think a sinker while bottom fishing and watching the rod tip for a bite). If the action is too fast or slow for your weight, you will not see the bite This also holds true to landing a fish, a slower action rod has more give and is best suited to fish that thrash around trying to throw the hook. Rod power is the amount of leverage or pulling power of the rod. The heavier the rating, the more leverage you will have over the fish, which helps in turning the fish's head, as well as landing it. You do not want to go too heavy on the power based on the species you are fishing for. If your power is too high for the species you are fishing for, you risk pulling the hook out. If the rod power is too light, you will not have enough leverage to land the fish.",How long should a trolling rod be?,"A trolling rod should be 5'6""-6'6"". Some center console guys prefer a 7' trolling rods to get up and around the outboard engines easier",What is the strongest fishing rod?,The strongest rod on the market currently is the Shimano Grappler series. These rods have dual carbon fiber wraps that protect the parabolic action of the blank and remove blank twist at the same time. The rods leverage point is lowered to the handle assisting the angler in landing the fish. ,How do I choose a saltwater rod?,"You must decide on the style of fishing you plan on doing. Anglers often choose a reel first, then match up a rod that balanced well when combined with the reel. You must make sure that the length of the rod is appropriate for what you will be doing. As a general rule, 6'6""-7' is best used on a boat where casting room is limited. From shore in West Palm Beach, 7'6-9' is often used to achieve greater casting distances. Fast action rods are great for casting and retrieving, moderate action rods are used more often for jigging and trolling. The right rod for you can be chosen on species of fish targeted, fishing location in West Palm Beach, line weight and rod power.",Can you use a jigging rod for other types fishing?,"jigging rods have a very specific length, action and power designed for working jigs vertically through the water column. Anglers often bottom fish with jigs in West Palm Beach, but a different style rod is needed for fishing baits or rigs on bottom vs. jigs. Your jigging rods are typically very short and have a slower, parabolic action. For this reason, it is extremely difficult to feel your bait and to achieve a positive hookset when fishing bottom with a jigging rod. ",How do I choose rod action?,"The right rod action for you is determined mainly by the type of lures or bait you will casting, jigging or trolling. Different techniques perform better on different action rods. For example, A fast or extra fast action rod is great for bottom fishing and casting lures in West Palm Beach. A moderate to slow action rod is best for presenting vertical and slow pitch jigs and achieving the greatest casting distance.",What is the best rod for when you want to troll?,"The best rod to troll with in Palm Beach is determined by a number of factors including species, location, type of fishing and the spread you are trolling.    However, there are many factors to determine which rod will be best for you.  Come speak to our professional Angler Advisors and they can assist you in the decision making process.",Are Shimano rods good?,Shimano rods are at the best production rods on the market. Every part of the rod has been maticulously thought out by Shimano to truly make the rod a functional part of the fish catching process.,Choosing Rod Length,"How do I choose a rod length? Short rods are better for shorter, more accurate or precise casting. Longer rods help you achieve greated casting distances. You need to consider the enviornemnt you will be fishing in around West Palm Beach. On A boat, there is seldom any reason to fish rods above 7 feet because casting room is usually limited. From shore, use a 7'6"" or longer to achieve a bit more distance and a bit more sensitivy in the added tip length. ",,

While there are definitely situations where this is a bonus, there are certain types of fishing that Heavy Tackle is the way to go in West Palm Beach. The advantage to using Heavy Tackle in West Palm Beach is you start off with an edge on the fish as soon as it strikes. This tackle gives you a massive amount of leverage and torque that many times are necessary to either turn a big fish�s head, pull them out from a hole or get a monster to the boat. Another place you will find heavy tackle a must is high speed trolling as the violent strikes from Wahoo put a tremendous amount of strain on your tackle.",What is considered Heavy Tackle in West Palm Beach?,"Heavy Tackle in West Palm Beach is not just the rod and reel, it is every part of your fishing setup. This includes the rod, reel, line and terminal tackle. A heavy tackle reel in West Palm Beach is going to be any conventional reel starting at a 50 class and up. For rods, a rod that has at minimum fast action and an extra heavy and higher rating on the blank. Terminal tackle starts at the 250lb class and this includes snap swivels, swivels and leaders whether that be mono, steel or cable. Heavy Tackle Line in West Palm Beach is at minimum 80lb and can be either mono or braided line. This combination of heavy tackle gives the angler an advantage over the fish and allows more room for error when fighting a large fish.",What types of lures will I be using with Heavy Tackle in West Palm Beach?,"The types of lures you will be using when Heavy Tackle fishing in West Palm Beach depends on your target species for the day. If you are targeting Wahoo when Heavy Tackle fishing in West Palm Beach, then you will be pull large lures that are run behind trolling leads that can weigh as much as 4 pounds. If you are bottom fishing for Amberjacks, instead of lures you will be using dead bait dropped around wrecks and the heavy tackle will assist you in winching up these strong fighters in West Palm Beach. While Blue Marling are not regularly targeted in West Palm Beach, there are many anglers that pull large lures on Heavy Tackle when the conditions are right as these acrobatic regularly cruise the waters.

Before you go buy a light tackle setup and go chasing the big fish you can, you want to make sure that the setup that you have is matched to your target species. For example, you do not want to go out with a light tackle setup and pitch baits at 200lb tarpon as you will be completely under geared and will get smoked by that tarpon in West Palm Beach. Where light tackle really shines is when you are targeting smaller species like trout, snapper, Spanish mackerel and redfish. There are times where light tackle can come into play just for the fun of it, like pitching to summer schooling Dolphin (Mahi Mahi). ",What is considered light tackle in West Palm Beach? ,"Light tackle fishing in West Palm Beach is different than other areas as the local fish population we have here are large. When it comes to reel size, light tackle is going to be the 5000 size and down. Once you cross over to 6000 and up, most reels weight, drag and size greatly increase. For line whether that be braid or mono 25lb and less will be considered light tackle in West Palm Beach. Some anglers may use 30lb braid on their light tackle setup if they need a bit more abrasion resistance. Rods are going to Medium in weight size and fast or lower action at the tip. The lighter blank and tip allow light tackle anglers to throw light lures farther and with more accuracy in West Palm Beach.",What type of lures will I be using light tackle fishing in West Palm Beach?,"When fishing in West Palm Beach, it is not as much about the type of lure that is considered light tackle, it is about the weight of the lure. The reason you are using these lighter lures is that they have the best presentation to the fish. Unlike many lures that you are just reeling in, many light tackle lures are going to be finessed to create the optimal action in West Palm Beach. Vudu Shrimp is a great example of this type of lure. They are extremely light and you are mimicking a shrimp floating along in the current using small twitches of your rod to impart action to it. Some of the most popular light tackle lures are Vudu Shrimp, Dartspin Lures, small spoons or jigs, soft plastics with weighted hooks and small top water plugs. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

What is the best monofilament fishing line for saltwater? First you want to look at your reel specifiactions and see the recommended size line. For each recommended size line you will want to look at how much monofilament line will fit on that particular reel. Now you need to deteremine which size is best for the type of fishing you plan on doing in West Palm Beach and if the amount of line for that size will be sufficient. For example, if you are trolling in West Palm Beach, you will want to have enough monofilament line to allow you to put your lures 100' behind the boat with enough leftover for when the fish bites and runs line off during the fight","For West Palm Beach Fishing, Choosing Braided Line","For West Palm Beach Fising, you want to choose a braided line that fits your style of fishing. When trolling in West Palm Beach, choose a braided line that has high visiablity so that you can see where your line enters the water to minimize crossing your other lines. For inshore fishing, you want a braided line that will maximize your casting ability. If you are bottom fishing in West Palm Beach, you want to choose a braided line that is heavier to give you more abrasion resistance for those rocks and reefs you will be drifting over.",Choosing Flourocarbon line for West Palm Beach Fishing,"When choosing flourocarbon line for your day of fishing in West Palm Beach, you want to take into consideration the type of fish you will be targeting as well as the enviroment they are in. For deep sea fishing applications, you want to match your flourocarbon line to the main line size such as 30lb braid gets 30lb flourocarcon. For inshore fishing in West Palm Beach, choosing a flourocarbon line is about the enviroment you will be fishing in. If you are fishing around docks, rock or oyster bars, choose a heavier flourocarbon line than your main line to minimize cut offs. Flourocarbon is a necessity in West Palm Beach because of the clear water.",What type of fishing line is best for saltwater?,"First you need to understand the benefits and disadvatage of each for the particular fishing you plan on doing.1. Mono - Stretches, Inexpensive, Semi-Transparent, Thick Diameter2. Flouro - Stretches, Abrasion Resistant, Transparent, Expensive for use other than leader material3. Braid - No Stretch, Increased Sensitivity, Easily Visible to Fish",What color braid is best for saltwater?,"Fishing Line Color depends on application:1. Deep Sea Fishing Trolling - Hi-Vis Yellow or Orange2. Deep Sea Bottom Fishing - Lo-Vis Green or Blue Camo3. Inshore Fishing - Lo-Vis Green or White",What pound test do I need for saltwater fishing?,While pound of test can greatly vary depending on the type of fish you are targeting. 30lb-40lb is a good general deep sea fishing pound test. ,What is the best line for a spinning reel?,"Since spinning reels are mainly used for casting, you will want to use braided line as it has a smaller diameter and has less friction allowing you to cast further and pack more line on your spinning reel.",Is fluorocarbon better than monofilament?,Flourocarbon and monofilament have the same breaking strength per pound. Flourocarbon is a bit more stiff than mono and provides a slightly higher abrasion resistance.,Is braid line best for spinning reels?,If you are solely using your spinning reel for casting then braid is the best choice as it allows you to cast farther than monofilament line and you can put more line on the spool ,Does braided line need a leader?,"Leader have two functions when used in conjuction with braided line. Since braid has no stretch, it can yank the hook out of the fishes mouth. The leader provides the extra stretch you need to absorb the energy from fish shaking their heads. Leaders are most important as fish can see braided line and mono is mostly transparent in the water",Flouro vs Mono in West Palm Beach for fishing,"What fishing line is better mono or braid? West Palm Beach has extremely clear water and there are situations where you are going to want to use flourocarbon instead of monofilament. Flourocarbon does not reflect light like monofilament does so in clear water it is almost invisible. Mono in most cases will be used to spool up a reel and used in enviroments where the fish are not as spooky (leader shy). Mono can used vs flouro as leader in applications such as trolling, bottom fishing and kite fishing. Flouro should be used when inshore fishing for species such as snook and tarpon.",,

In the summer snook, tarpon and big jack crevalle are mainly targeted along the beach. Swimbaits will catch all 3 of these species, but are best for snook and tarpon. For the best action on the beach, try to find a swimbait that has a flat belly because they roll better over sand. In the late summer, use a small presentation around 2-3 inches with a strong hook to match the hatch of a glass minnow and catch some tarpon. Jack Crevalle love anything shiny and moving fast, Throw a big surface plug or metal jig and rip it back along the surface. In the fall and winter, pompano and spanish mackerel populate the surf zone in palm beach. Use a light tackle setup to cast small hi-low rigs with cut bait, goofy jigs or small metal jigs on a flourocarbon leader.

Use a sabiki rig in shallower water around buoys and bottom structure near Palm Beach Inlet. If you have a dock or access to the intracoastal near Palm Beach Inlet and want to catch your own bait, place a pinfish trap with some fish heads, chicken pieces or a can of cat food with some holes poked in it. If you are proficient with a cast net and want to catch your own bait, put a chum bag out behind the boat in about 40' of water and wait for the small bait fish to come to you. ",Finding bait in West Palm to cast net,"If you want to cast net for your bait in West Palm Beach, first you will want at least an 8' cast net with a mesh size of about 1/4""-1/2"". For pilchards and mullet, you want to look in the intracoastal water about 10' or less that also provides some cover like docks and trees. Another overlooked area to use your cast net to catch bait is right off the beach in West Palm. Get in as tight as you can to shore without risking being caught by a wave that could push you into shore and throw your cast net as the bait schools run along the beach. Whether you are looking for live bait near structure or the beach, the key is to be ahead of where you believe the school will be running and make as few tosses as possible to not spook the bait school. ","I am in West Palm Beach, should I use mono or wire Pre-Rigged Ballyhoo Bait in West Palm Beach?",Choosing between Mono or Wire rigged ballyhoo depends on what fish are in the area you plan on trolling. Fish can see the wire easier and may affect the bite. Mono is a much stealthier approach and should be used when you may encounter Tuna. Use wire when you think there may be Wahoo in the area you are trolling. ,How do I use a sabiki to catch live bait around West Palm Beach?,"The most important thing you want to make sure of is that you are using a fluorocarbon sabiki. Find a buoy or small reef structure that may hold bait. Once you see the bait fish on your fish finder, let out the sabiki and gently jig until you feel the bait fish bite. Use a small dehooker when removing fish from the sabiki.",Where should I use a cast net for live bait in West Palm Beach?,"You will want to find an area that bait fish feel protected from larger fish when locating a spot to cast net bait. Look for docks, pilings, buoys, trees and oyster bars. The area around Munyon Island is particularly productive for cast netting when fishing in the Palm Beaches",Where in West Palm Beach should I use a sabiki to catch live bait?,You want to use a sabiki to catch live bait in shallower water off of West Palm Beach around buoys and reef structure. You can also use a sabiki with a heavier weight should you mark bait fish in deeper water.,How do I rig an offshore West Palm Beach ballyhoo bait for trolling?,"Purchase a bait spring (nose cone) ballyhoo rig. Line the hook up with the ballyhoo and punch a small hole with the tip of the hook where the hook will exit the ballyhoo on it�s belly. Push the hook from behind the gills through the body and then through the hole you made on the belly. Finally, twist the bait spring around the pin and beak of the ballyhoo till tight and break off the excess beak.",What kinds of fish in West Palm Beach will I catch with a rigged Mullet bait?,Trolling a rigged Mullet bait will produce all varieties of fish in West Palm Beach. Mainly you will catch Wahoo and King Mackerel but do not be surprised if a big Mahi eats the bait as well. ,Should I use Live or Frozen bait in West Palm Beach for bottom fishing?,"You will usually have a better bite when using a lively live bait for bottom fishing in West Palm Beach. However, live bait is not always readily available, a close second would be frozed sardines or ballyhoo.",Using a Sabiki in West Palm Beach for Bait ,"Using a sabiki to catch bait in West Palm Beach is the most popular, easiest and definitely much cleaner. The number one golden rule when using a Sabiki in West Palm Beach for bait fish is to use a fluorocarbon sabiki rig. Our experts have tested mono vs fluoro sabikis on all types of bait fish and we can tell you that the fluoro rigs far outperform the mono ones. Attach the rig to a medium to medium heavy rod and lower the rig to the desired depth. Once there, use a small up and down motion with the rod to bring the small flies on the Sabiki rig to life.

When choosing lures for  West Palm Beach, you must first decide what species of fish you�re after. How do I know what fishing lure to use?  Anglers often troll a mixed spread for local species. Use smaller lures that run along the surface for the pelagics. Small feathers, daisy chains and jet head lures are also good for targeting them. Anglers fishing off West Palm Beach also regularly troll a lure or two  deep. Diving plugs like the Yo-Zuri divebaits or a planer combined with a large feather or skirted ballyhoo are great lures for trolling in West Palm Beach. If you�re after toothy fast fish, choose lures for trolling that are big and loud. Light lures are combined with a cigar weight to keep in beneath the surface. For less rigging, choose lures like the 32 oz. Cowbell or weighted high speed lure which already weighted and do not require the use of a cigar weight. If you�re choosing lures for trolling for kings, try something that vibrates heavily in the water like a King-zig, Drone Spoon or a Lipped Plug in West Palm Beach.",Choosing lures for casting in West Palm Beach,"Choosing lures for casting in West Palm Beach can be a challenging task for anglers new to using artificial baits and lures. What are the best lures for saltwater fishing? The fish in Palm Beach are heavily pressured so choosing a lure that casts far is essential for more subtle presentations. The small jigs are a fantastic option for casting long distances to pelagic species on the surface. If the fish are deeper in the water column, a heavier jig is a great lure to choose for casting in West Palm Beach. If you are choosing lures for casting to the inshore species in West Palm Beach, you need to consider that often times, the fish are right on the bottom so selecting a lure that sweeps just off the bottom is essential. Flair hawk jigs and big swimbaits are great lures to cast inshore because the vibrations from these lures causes a natural reaction strike from the fish, even when they are not the mood to feed.",Choosing lure colors in West Palm Beach,"Choosing lure colors in West Palm Beach is a simple process of trial and error. Remember that ever day on the water is different. What color are fish attracted to?  Begin your morning troll with a variety of colors in the spread. If you notice a particular color is getting bites more than the rest, simply switch out more lures that color! As a general rule of thumb in West Palm Beach, try using darker colors in low light conditions like black and purple, then transition to brighter colors like blue, pink and white as the sun rises higher in the sky. For the superstitious fishermen, tuna always love black and purple lures, mahi love pink and white and wahoo love blue and white lures in West Palm Beach.",What is the best lure with ballyhoo in West Palm Beach?,"A skirted ballyhoo pin rig. The swimming action of the ballyhoo combined with the larger profile, action and color contrast of the skirt offers an unbeatable presentation for mahi of all sizes. Also, offering a bit of real meat to the fish helps the mahi commit after coming up behind the lure, especially the big bulls.",What is the best lure for tuna in West Palm Beach?,The best trolling lure for tuna is a 1/2 oz black and purple feather in West Palm Beach. Troll this lure way back behind the boat in clean water for the best presentation. The best casting/jigging lure for blackfin is a flat fall butterfly jig. ,What is the best lure for inshore in West Palm Beach?,The best lure for inshore in West Palm Beach is a 1.5oz. Red head Chartruese body and blue tail Flair Hawk jig. The fish feel the vibration that the crimped nylon hair on the jig puts out in the water in their latteral line. This action drives them crazy and triggers a reaction strike from the snook when presented properly. ,What color lure to use in saltwater?,"Start with a varierty of different colors in your offshore spread. How do I choose a lure? As you begin getting bites, take note of what color is producing the best results and switch out the unproductive colors. As a general rule in Palm Beach, Use darker colors in low light conditions and brighter colors as the sun rises higher in the sky throughout the day. ",What color lure should I use inshore?,"What color lure you should use inshore in West Palm Beach is determined by the water clarity and tide. Normally, Incoming tide in West Palm Beach brings in clean ocean water that is extremely clear. The fish can see everything when the water is clear. Natural colors like white, pink, blue and olive work best in clear water. During the outgoing tide, water is flushed from the freshwater rivers out the inlets causing the water to be stained and dirty. In dirty water, use chartreuse so the fish can pick up on the lure's profile with little visability. ",What is the best lure for fishing the beach?,The best lure for fishing the beach in West Palm Beach is a large paddletail swimbait. The belly on these swimbaits are flat which allow it to roll over a sandy bottom better than other swimbaits and it has a quality hook which is important for fishing lures West Palm Beach. ,Can you use a lure with a bobber?,"Anglers in West Palm Beach don't use traditional bobbers when fishing with lures. Instead, a popping cork is used to keep your lure presented in the strike zone and tear up the surface to catch the attention of nearby fish. ",Best lure for fishing off of West Palm Beach,"The best lure for fishing in west palm beach is a skirted ballyhoo pin rig. A wide variety of lures work well, but a skirted ballyhoo works best, and the pin rigs are simple and efficient to rig. Often, the fish in West Palm Beach are finicky and hesitant to hit a lure that does not look completely natural. The swimming action of the ballyhoo combined with the larger profile, action and color contrast of the skirt offers an unbeatable presentation. Also, offering a bit of real meat to the fish helps the mahi commit after coming up behind the lure, especially the big bulls. Rig the hook through the gills and out the belly of the ballyhoo. Make sure the egg sinker is tucked snug inside the gills of the bait.

Use a sabiki rig in shallower water around bouys and bottom structure near West Palm Beach Inlet. If you have a dock or access to the intracoastal inshore waters near West Palm Beach Inlet and want to catch your own bait, place a pinfish trap with some fish heads, chicken pieces or a can of cat food with some holes poked in it. If you are proficient with a cast net and want to catch your own bait, put a chum bag out behind the boat in about 40' of water and wait for the small bait fish to come to you. ",Finding live bait in West Palm Beach,"If you want to cast net for your live bait in West Palm Beach, first you will want at least an 8' cast net with a mesh size of about 1/4""-1/2"". For pilchards and mullet, you want to look in the intracoastal water about 10' or less that also provides some cover like docks and trees. Another overlooked area to use your cast net to catch bait is right off the beach in West Palm. Get in as tight as you can to shore without risking being caught by a wave that could push you into shore and throw your cast net as the live bait schools run along the beach. Whether you are looking for live bait near sctructure or the beach, the key is to be ahead of where you believe the school will be running and make as few tosses as possible to not spook the bait school.

Our experts have tested mono vs flouro sabikis on all types of livebait fish and we can tell you that the flouro rigs far outperform the mono ones. Attach the rig to a medium to medium heavy rod and lower the rig to the desired depth. Once there, use a small up and down motion with the rod to bring the small flies on the Sabiki rig to life. You will feel the bait when they bite in West Palm Beach. We always give it a few seconds before retrieving the sabiki once a bait fish is on to allow a few more to bite for a multiple hookup.

If you are going out and do not have much time, it is best to buy from a bait boat so you do not waste any precious fishing time locating and catching live bait. There are also times during the year when bait is hard to find and if you do not know exactly where to look, you may spend hours trying to find them only to catch a few or none at all.",How do you catch Live Bait from shore?,The best way to catch live bait from shore in West Palm Beach is to cast net them.

Becoming profeicient with even a small cast net will guarantee you at minimum a few live baits each time you go fishing. ,What is the best live bait for saltwater fishing?,"Truthfully, most fish will eat almost any other type of fish if presented properly.

Cobia are opportunistic feeders meaning that they are not just hunting for fish, they are instead looking for an easy meal. You will see Cobia following sharks and rays as they eat the leftovers from the rays and sharks. Cobia also like to hang out around reefs in West Palm Beach. These reefs allow the cobia a chance at an easy meal and when predatory fish come in, they also get to eat the scraps leftover from it.  ",How to fish for Cobia in West Palm Beach ,"There are two ways that you will want to target Cobia in West Palm Beach. First is looking for schools of sharks and/or rays. When you located sharks or rays, use a large bucktail jig with either a jig tail or a rubber �worm� style on the jig. Cast the jig behind the sharks or rays and allow it to get down a bit before jigging it back to you in West Palm Beach. If you do not get a cobia after a few casts, send the jig to the bottom and briskly work it back up to the boat. The other way is to find high relief structure on the bottom. Watch your bottom sounder and locate structure that has a decent amount of bait on it. Send a big live bait down and do not put it directly on the bottom. Allow the bait to swim about 10� above the top of the structure. This will be in the cobias feeding zone without other reef fish trying to eat your bait in West Palm Beach. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

These reels are absolutely worth the money and you will know it when a fish of a lifetime is on and the smooth action and superior drag of the Stella actually assists you in landing the fish.,charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,Choosing a West Palm Beach Shimano Fishing Reel,West Palm Beach is an exceptional fishery that can put anglers to the test as most anglers opt for bullet proof but lightweight fishing gear. Shimano is at the forefront of reel technology and packs an amazing amount of features and durability in a small package. You want a conventional reel that can easily be used for stand up fishing but has enough backbone to stop those pelagic fish in their tracks. A Shimano Talica is a beast of a reel with a smooth drag and enough line capacity to battle any fish you may catch in West Palm Beach. For spinning reels you will want a combination of Shimano Stella for jigging and pitching and a Shimano Thunnus Bait Runner for live baiting and chunking.,Shimano Reel to use for Fishing in West Palm Beach,"When fishing in West Palm Beach you want to have a mix of reels to cover all types of fishing you will be doing. For trolling you will want Shimano Talica. It is best to have a variety of sizes, a standard reel package would be 2 Talica 16II - 4 Talica 25II - 2 Talica 50II - 2 Talica BFC and 1 Tiagra 80. A standard spinning reel package would be 4 Stella 10K - 2 Thunnus 12K - 2 Twin Power 10K - 4 Saragosa 8K. You will also want to have 2 Shimano Beast master electric reels for deep dropping and for ktie fishing. Finally, you will want 4 Shimano Speedmaster 16 reels for bottom fishing and jigging.  ",Selecting a Shimano Reel in West Palm Beach for Inshore Fishing,"You will need to select a variety of shimano reels for inshore fishing in west palm beach. A 3000-5000 sized Shimano Stradic FL or Spheros SW is what you need for catching the smaller inshore species like pompano, Spanish mackerel and snapper. You will also need a 6000-8000 sized shimao saragossa or twin power for casting at the snook and tarpon from the beaches and jetties. There are also two conventional Shimano reels you will need for inshore fishing in West Palm Beach. Use a 16-20 Sized Shimano Speedmaster or Torium for catching big snook with bait on bottom. For casting artificial jigs, swimbaits and lures from bridges or piers, use a Shimano tranx low profile conventional reel so you can cast precisely and touch your rod to the railing of the bridge or pier with a big fish on. Make sure you are selecting a quality Shimano reel with cross carbon drag, X-protect and and x-shield so it will last a long time and can handle the powerful runs these fish take towards structure.�",What is the warranty on Shimano Fishing Reels?,Shimano warrants that their reels are free from defects in material and workmanship when used in normal conditions and reasonable use for a period of 2 years.

What Rod should I buy?  As most anglers use a lighter rod for deep sea fishing and stronger rods for inshore fishing, you want a rod that can handle both of these situations. For your boat rod, you want a Shimano Terez with dual carbon fiber wraps.

This is a great technique if there have been a few days of East winds, which tend to blow a lot of debris closer to shore. This is also a great technique in West Palm Beach for when it is flat calm because you can quickly run the boat around and locate floating structure or large weed patches easily. Once you find some schools of Mahi, either pitch to them with spinning rods or troll around the debris to raise some fish. If the fish are more scattered about, or there is no floating debris or weed lines, then trolling is a great way to cover some water and find some fish. When blind trolling, it is always important to find something different before sending the lines out, whether it be a current break, temperature change, or  baitfish. You want to make sure you are in an area that could potentially be holding some fish before starting to troll.",Best Time of Day to Catch Mahi in West Palm Beach,"Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) are primarily day time feeders. The best time of day to catch Mahi Mahi is when the sun is up high in the sky. Lowlight conditions are often not the most productive times to catch Mahi. Many anglers in West Palm Beach will spend the lowlight hours of the day targetting other fish then transition over to mahi fishing once the sun is up high in the sky. The reason for this is that when Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) are most active and can best be seen by the angler. A large part of fishing for Mahi is seeing them. Locating them under floating structure, weed patches or in your spread is essential to getting your bait infront of the fish and presenting it properly. If there is a lot of glare on the water and you try to look underneath a weed line or floating pallet, you will not be able to see them, even if they are there! ",Trolling spread for Mahi in West Palm Beach,"Trolling is one of the most effective ways to locate schools of Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) in West Palm Beach, especially when there is not a lot of floating debris, weed lines or the fish are just scattered throughout a certain depth range. The reason for this is that you can cover a lot more water and you can offer the fish a variety of different baits and lure combinations to really key into what the fish want to bite on that specific day. Every day on the water in West Palm Beach is different and dialing in on the action, color, and size profile that the Mahi want can be the difference in catching just a few or no fish at all and filling the cooler with your limit! We have found lots of success while trolling two lures down deeper in the water column off the corners, two skirted jet head lures rigged with ballyhoo off the short outrigger clip in the middle ground, two small skirted lures rigged with bonita strips off the long rigger clips way back and a cedar plug daisy chain way back down the center. ",Best Time of Year to Catch Mahi in West Palm Beach,Where can I fish for Mahi Mahi?,"Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) push in closer to West Palm Beach than any other location in Florida. This is because the Gulf Stream Currents come closer to shore here than anywhere else. Mahi are commonly caught just a few miles off the beach. The current conditions including wind and swell direction will determine where the bait, structure and most importantly, the fish are. Mahi are caught anywhere from 60'-1000+ feet of water off West Palm Beach. Most commonly though, they are caught in 300-600 feet of water off West Palm Beach.",How do you fish for Mahi Mahi in Florida?,"Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) are fished for using a few different techniques here in West Palm Beach. Trolling, Chunking and Run & Gun are the top three techniques used to cover water to locate and catch the Mahi Mahi in West Palm Beach.",When can you catch Mahi Mahi?,"Mahi Mahi can be caught year-round in West Palm Beach. However, the best action is during the summer months. August in the best select month for Mahi Mahi fishing in West Palm Beach because many of the larger fish from the Florida Keys begin migrating north right by West Palm Beach.",What bait do you use for Mahi Mahi?,"Squid and Sardines are the top bait choices while chunking for Mahi Mahi in West Palm Beach. For anglers trolling, Bonita strips and Ballyhoo are the best bait to use.",What is the best lure of Mahi Mahi?,"Mahi Mahi will strike a variety of both trolling and casting lures. The number one best lure to use for Mahi Mahi is the 1.5 oz sinking Shimano SP Orca Baby Jigs. These jigs are extremely versitile so they are extremely effective. Pitch one along a weed line, let it drop down deep in the water column then work it back to the surface, or cast it out and skip it along the surface for an aggresive topwater strike. ",How do I fish a weed line for Mahi Mahi?,"Mahi Mahi love congregating in schools underneath weed patches and weed lines off West Palm Beach. Many anglers will troll the perimiter of the weed patch or up and down the weed line with great success, but there are more effective and efficient ways to catch them when they are tight to structure. Pitching and Chunking are much more effective techniques for catching Mahi on structure. Trolling is a great way to cover water, but the fish are already located so casting directly to them is the way to go. Cut up some chunks of frozen squid or sardines and chum the water to attract the Mahi away from the floating debris then bait a chunk on a hook and let it free fall naturally with the other chunks. Casting lures is also extremely productive on weed lines, especially when the fish are fired up. Cast a small jig or spoon near the weedline. Either let the jig fall down deep and work it back to the surface or skip the lure across the surface for a visual strike.",Why should I keep the first Mahi I hook in the water?,"Keeping the first Mahi you hook in the water near the boat is a great way to keep the school close by. The remainder of the school will follow the fish to investigate as Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) are curious by nature and keeping a light but steady flow of cut bait to the school will  keep them around the boat. Often times, this leads to great opportunities to pick off an entire school in a very short period of time. Move on to the next school and repeat the process!","The best time of year to catch Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) in West Palm Beach is summer time. Usually, in the summer, anglers in West Palm Beach are greeted with flat calm seas, so there are many great opportunities to run and gun to locate strucutre the Mahi will be hiding under. Also, in the calm, clear summertime conditions, it is extremely easy to locate floating pieces of debris on the surface. Not only is it a little easier to target them in the summer but also becuase the fish are here in large schools! West Palm Beach is home to large schools of Mahi throughout the summer months so they are one of the top choices for deep sea anglers. Later in the summer, towards the middle of August, West Palm Beach usually sees a big push of big bull Mahi migrating up from the Florida keys. For this reason, August is considered one of the better times of year to catch Mahi in West Palm Beach.",,,

The Sailfish in South Florida are typically slightly smaller than other locations around the world, but we do see a number of triple digit fish each year. The Florida State record Sailfish is 126 Lbs",charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,Sailfish Season in West Palm Beach,"Sailfish can be caught all year-round in West Palm Beach, but most people don�t begin targetting them until they really start pushing through in the winter months. There are some resident Sailfish that cruise just off of West Palm Beach 365 days a year, but there just are not enough of them for anglers to get after them. During the season, it is not uncommon for boats to release upwards of 10-12 Sails on any given day. The peak season lasts from January through March. It is all dertermined by the weather. Once a few cold fronts come rolling through West Palm Beach, Sailfish season begins. If it is cold outside, the wind is blowing East and some recent cold fronts have been coming through, then it must be Sailfish season! ",How to catch Sailfish in West Palm Beach,"Sailfish anglers generally use one of two techniques when targetting Sailfish in West Palm Beach. The number one and best technique for catching Sailfish in West Palm Beach is Kite Fishing. This is because it is the most effective technique as you have a live bait, with minimal terminal tackle and line in the water making it the most natural presentation for the fish. The only down side to kite fishing is that it can be challenging for anglers who have not done it before and it is best to seek advice from your local tackle shop. Some anglers in West Palm Beach prefer to bump troll their live baits, slowly pulling the boat in and out of gear to naturally present the live baits. The problem with bump trolling is that you kill your baits a lot easier, it is not as good of a presentation, you will gut hook more fish and it is less efficient than kite fishing. ",Where to catch Sailfish Florida,"""Sailfish Alley"" is a 60 mile stretch ranging from Fort Pierce to West Palm Beach. The best part of catching the Sailfish in West Palm Beach is that you do not need to go far offshore to catch them. Most of the Sailfish caught here in West Palm Beach are inside of three miles from the inlet. During the peak of the season, many anglers fishing off of West Palm Beach run out to around 150' which is only about 1.5 miles off the beach. The gulf stream runs closer to West Palm Beach than anywhere else along the East Coast so it is a great location to catch a number of Sails while staying close to shore. ",Where can I catch Sailfish in West Palm Beach?,"Sailfish are caught off West Palm Beach mainly between 90 and 300 feet. This dept range from Port St. Lucie to West Palm Beach is known as ""Sailfish Alley"" around the world.",What is the best month to catch a Sailfish in West Palm Beach,February is usually the best bet for catching Sailfish in West Palm Beach. We are typically right in heart of Sailfish season and will have had a few decent cold fronts to turn on the bite. Many anglers are usually experiencing double digit release days by February.,Can you keep Sailfish in Florida?,"Most of the Sailfish caught in South Florida are released due to the fact that they are widely considered to be a ""Trophy Fish"". Their sheer beauty and awesome sportfish qualities is what causes many anglers to strictly catch and release their Sailfish. On top of that, they are known for not having the best quality meat. Many anglers firmly believe they are worth far more alive than on the table. However, it is legal to harvest 1 Sailfish per angler in Florida, as long as it is 63"" or greater when measured from the lower jaw to the fork of the tail but must be reported to the NOAA within 24 hours of harvest.",How hard is it to catch a Sailfish?,"Sailfishing can be challenging for new anglers just, especially kite fishing in West Palm Beach. It is important to research your preferred technique and become knowledable with exactly what everything is along with when, where and why to use it. We always reccomend for new kite anglers to start slow. 1 kite and 1 bait is a great way to learn you way around the rigging, the gear and what to do when a fish bites. After you are comfortable fishing one rod, you can refine your technique, add more kites and baits to dial it in and  become more effient. Efficiency is key for Sailfishing in West Palm Beach. Anlgers who learn to be efficient on a small scale typically are much more successful when it comes time to incorperate more lines and more advanced techniques.",How do you fish for Sailfish?,"Anglers in West Palm Beach typically use one of two techniques for catching Sailfish. Kite Fishing is the most popular and most efficient technique. It includes presenting a live baitfish just under the surface of the water from a kite flying in the air. Another technique used in West Palm Beach is bump trolling your live baits. You may not get as many bites becuase the presentation is not as effective, and it is nearly impossible to catch and release fish as quick as the anglers using kites, but it is a much simplier technique that can work. ",How fast is a Sailfish?,Sailfish are widely considered to be one of the fastest swimming fish in the ocean. They have been clocked in at speeds in excess of 68 MPH. ,What hooks should I be using for Sailfish?,6/0-8/0 inline perfect circle hooks. 7/0 are most commonly used. Inline circle hooks are essential to the survival of the fish after releasing. ,When can I catch a Sailfish in West Palm Beach?,"Peak Sailfishing season occurs between December and March each year.  When the cold fronts start rolling through West Palm Beach, so do the Sails. They like the chilly air, rough water conditions and the bait movement associated with both of these factors. The Sailfish hang out North of South Florida in the spring, summer and fall and begin migrating south as both the air and water temperatures begin to drop. However, West Palm Beach is home to a smaller population of resident Sailfish that feed right off West Palm Beach all year-round, offering local anglers the shot at one of these acrobatic trophy fish 365 days a year.

Use only as little of a weight as possible to hold bottom, no more than what you need. If the Mangrove Snapper are hitting light or subtle, try downsizing your weight size. Not only will this make the bite much easier to feel, the fish are less likely to drop the bait after picking it up. ",,

They swim in large and very fast moving schools. These schools of Mackerel follow the rising water temperatures along the east coast and prefer temperatures of at least 70 degrees,charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,Fishing for Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach,"Spanish Mackerel are a fun fish to target and catch in West Palm Beach. Spanish Mackerel hunt in schools and when you get one on, be assured there are many more in the area. These fish like anything that is shiny and flashy and will chase lures that move quickly through the water. One of the reasons they are so enjoyable to catch in West Palm Beach is that you can use light tackle and enjoy the fight they put on. Spanish Mackerel have extremely sharp teeth, and you need to make sure your tackle and leaders can handle this without being cut off. Spanish Mackerel are mainly found around shallower waters of 80� or less and are well known for running in the surf.  ",Tackle Setups for Catching Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach,"There are two basic setups that you will want when targeting Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach. First is a spinning setup that you can use to either throw small lures or use to catch your bait. You will want to use a reel in the 3000-5000 class with a medium light rod and a more moderate to slower action tip. Your rod should be an inshore style setup for casting light lures as you will be casting around a lot and actively working your lures when fishing for Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach. Secondly, you will want a small conventional setup in the 12-20 class on a medium light rod with a moderate to slower tip as well. This setup can be used either to troll small lures or can be used as a rod for catching bait. Regardless of whether you go with a spinning setup or conventional setup for Spanish Mackerel fishing in West Palm Beach, 20lb braid is all you will need followed by a lengthy section of leader preferably tipped with a small piece of wire.",Targeting Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach ,"There are many ways to target Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach, but there are two top preferred methods by anglers fishing in West Palm Beach. First, is trolling for them. This is by far the simplest way to get some Spanish Mackerel into the boat and allows you to cover more ground and find some fish. Troll either a small spoon or a small flashy feather; start shallow around 20� and work your way out as you go back and forth along the beach. However, the single most preferred and most efficient technique is by throwing lures at Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach. Small spoons and Got-Cha plugs are by far the two most popular lures to cast at Spanish Mackerel. Many times, you will see schools busting bait on the surface and they will also jump out on the water helping you to identify them. Cast your spoon or plug on the edge of the school and reel fast. If you are forced to pull your lure through the school in West Palm Beach, try and cast over the school and bring your lure back through them.",What is the best water temperature for Spanish Mackerel?,"For Spanish Mackerel to be around, the water must be at least 70 degrees. ",What is the best time of year to catch Spanish Mackerel?,November-December is the best time of year to catch Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach,What is the best bait to use for Spanish Mackerel?,"The best bait to use for Spanish Mackerel is a live pilchard either free lined, fished with a small pinch weight or a popping cork",What is the best lure to use for Spanish Mackerel?,The best lure to use for the Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach is the Got-Cha 1500 series,Do you have to bleed Spanish Mackerel?,"Bleeding your Spanish Mackerel will result in the cleanest, best tasting fillets possible and is always reccomended.","Where can I find Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach, FL?","Spanish Mackerel are a shallow water migratory species commonly found around the surf zone of West Palm Beach. They can be caught along the beach, in the inlets, at the piers and on a boat casting behind the breaking surf. ",Best Leader for Spanish Mackerel?,"12"" of #6 or smaller wire or 30# flourocarbon leader is reccomended for catching the Spanish Mackerel in West Palm Beach ",Catching Spanish Mackerel from Shore in West Palm Beach,"Spanish Mackerel are one of the most sought after species of fish caught in the surf in West Palm Beach. They are hard fighters, plentyful and delicious. Spanish Mackerel commonly run through the surf zone in West Palm Beach year-round, but the winter months are always prime time. Small Spoons, casting jigs, crappie jigs and free lined live baits either casted freely or fished behind a popping cork are all top producers of spanish mackerel in the surf. When fishing with artificial lures, skip them quickly across the surface of the water for aggressive reaction strikes. Walk the beach until you find some visible action along the surface. Look for Mackerel skyrocketing out of the water on small baitfish right in the wash. Often times, you will see them in a feeding frenzy right along the beach. ",,

Throughout the year, small Jack Crevalle are caught throughout the inlets, bridges, ICW sea walls and just about anywhere baitfish swim in West Palm Beach. They are fun to catch but have no real value other than a decent fight and good bait. However, starting around the mullet run and persisting throughout the winter months and anytime there is big swell in the inlets, schools of big bruiser Jack Crevalle light up the Lake Worth Inlet in West Palm Beach. They can also be found in the ICW behind West Palm Beach pushing baitfish up against the sea walls during the day. Jack Crevalle are one of the toughest fighting inshore game fish and are known for being extremely hard fighters. They are known for taking a huge first run, then turning sideways and dogging you with their weight as you crank them in. The big schools of Jack Crevalle are very aggressive in West Palm Beach and can be seen chasing and crashing baitfish across the surface when they are around in good numbers. Make sure you are fishing strong enough tackle for the big Jack Crevalle, West Palm Beach is home to some of the biggest Jacks in the world! ",Lures for Jack Crevalle in West Palm Beach,"Jack Crevalle are extremely aggressive fish that are quick to strike a quick moving, noisy surface plug, spoon, casting jig or sub surface swimming plug. Small Jack Crevalle will hit just about anything moving in West Palm Beach. Anything from a crappie jig, to a small spoon or hard lure to a piece of cut bait will get eaten by small Jack Crevalle. However, the big ones in West Palm Beach are looking to crash large baitfish on the surface. Big surface plugs are often the most productive when the big Jacks are cruising around West Palm Beach because you can rip them fast, and they create a large disturbance on the surface which the Jack Crevalle are looking for. Spoons, casting jigs and GT Ice cream style lures work extremely well in West Palm Beach too because you can cast them farther than a topwater and the shimmer will attract the fish from a far. Hard lipped plugs like the Rapala X- Rap are often used when big Jack Crevalle are around West Palm Beach because the fish will not destroy the lure, they�re quick to grab it and you do not eliminate your chance of catching other species like you do when fishing a big topwater. ",Rigging up for Jack Crevalle in West Palm Beach,"The Jack Crevalle in West Palm Beach like feeding in areas of heavy structure like inlet jetties for example. Your rig for Jack Crevalle will vary slightly depending on where you are targeting them, but for the most part, you want a long rod for distance casting and an extra-long fluorocarbon leader for abrasion resistance around the rocks in West Palm Beach. The Jack Crevalle in the Inlet at West Palm Beach love to dive for the rocks when you get them close so using a long fluorocarbon leader is essential for landing big jacks in the rocks. 80-100# leader is preferred for big Jack Crevalle in West Palm Beach because they are not leader shy and you need the abrasion resistance in the rocks. Having a long heavy leader is also essential for grabbing on to when landing the fish. The heavier the leader, the easier it is to grab and pull the fish in. Ball bearing swivels are often used when casting and retrieving for larger Jack Crevalle in West Palm Beach because the lures you will be using cause a lot of line twist when ripped fast. The ball bearing swivels will allow your line to spin freely without twisting, which will result in less breakoffs throughout the day.

March through May is the best time to be targetting them in South Florida, while the water and air temperatures are still cool. They come through again in the fall starting around October and November, but they are not typically as thick as they are in the spring. ",Best Fishing Conditions for Tuna (Blackfin) in West Palm Beach,"When the weather is cool, and the seas are a bit rougher in the spring and fall, anglers in West Palm Beach have Blackfin Tuna on their minds. Once some cold fronts begin rolling through in October, the bite really begins. The shorter days with cooler air and cooler water temperatures is what really gets these fish going. Cloudy, overcast days and low light periods are the best conditions for the Blackfin, and they really thrive when there is a good chop on the surface of the water. Low light conditions (first light, last light, and overcast days) are always the best for catching Blackfin Tuna, as they are extremely light sensitive. During these times, the Tuna can spot the baitfish on the surface better and are more precise in their attacks. When the sun is high in the sky, the Tuna stay deep, looking up to feed becuase the light reflecting off the baitfish on the surface hightlights them in a sense, and makes them easier to see. While in low light conditions, the contrast between the baitfish and the surface of the water is increased making it even easier for the Tuna to key in, find and attack that baitfish. ",How to Catch Tuna (Blackfin) in West Palm Beach,"Tuna (Blackfin) are the most commonly targeted and caught species of Tuna in South Florida. They range in size from just a few pounds to upwards of 40 pounds. They typically travel in large schools of mixed sizes in West Palm Beach and they are extremely boat shy as they have great eyesight. Small lures, fished far away from the back of your boat is key. They are usually targetted in the 150-500 foot depth range off West Palm Beach. Most common techniques for catching Blackfin Tuna in West Palm Beach usually include vertical jigging, live chumming with pilchards or sardines or trolling small feathers. Blackfin Tuna have incredibly good eye sight so light flourocarbon leader, small hooks and baits placed far behind the boat are essential when targetting them. ",How do you catch Blackfin Tuna in West Palm Beach?,"Blackfin Tuna are caught using a variety of Tehniques in West Palm Beach including trolling, vertical jigging, live chumming, and drift fishing",Where can I catch Blackfin Tuna in West Palm Beach?,Blackfin Tuna are regularly caught off West Palm Beach from 150-450 feet of water. A large majority of the biggest blackfin taken each year are caught in water less than 300 feet.,Do you need to bleed Blackfin Tuna?,"Yes. Tuna require some prep work before icing to help keep the meat the best it can be for the table. Use a serrated blade knife to remove the gills of the tuna, then make a small slice directly behind the pectoral fin on the side of the Tuna to bleed it out. Removing the guts from the Tuna and stuffing the cavity with ice is reccomended but not always necessary. After making these incisions, place the fish in a bucket of salt water to let it bleed out and then bury the fish in ice once it is bled properly. A saltwater slush is reccomended for keeping Tuna the coldest. ",What is the best bait for tuna fishing?,"The best bait for catching Tuna (Blackfin) in West Palm Beach is live Pilchards or Spanish Sardines. Black out your live well with these baitfish and live chum them. When fishing with live baits for Tuna, make sure your lines are fare enough behind the boat that they are not spooked and will take the bait without hesitation.",How many Blackfin Tuna can you keep?,"You can keep 2 Tuna (Blackfin) per person per day, or 10 per vessel, whichever comes first. The season is open all year-round.",How fast do you troll for Blackfin Tuna,The best Tuna (Blackfin) trolling speed ranges from 6-9 knts. (7-11 MPH),What should I look for while Tuna Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"There are a few key things to keep an eye out for while targeting Tuna (Blackfin) in West Palm Beach. The first is clean water, Tuna thrive in clean water and will amost always be found on the cleaner side of a break. Bait and Birds are the next thing to keep an eye out for. Baitfish balled up on the surface, and small clusters of birds picking along the surface are both very good signs of some Tuna feeding in the area. ",Trolling and Best Bait for Tuna (Blackfin) in West Palm Beach,Deciding whether to troll or live bait chunk for Tuna (Blackfin) in West Palm Beach really comes down to your preference. Live Bait chunking will by far produce larger and more tunas if you know where to find them.

The key to trolling for any tuna in West Palm Beach is to have the lines way back and in clean water. You do nto want your lures in the propwash or bubbles from the boat.,,

They can be found on the beach, in the inlets or on the bridges, especially at night. The best Tarpon fishing in West Palm Beach happens every year around the mullet run which generally starts towards the end of September and persists through October. However, there are resident Tarpon that live in West Palm Beach year around. Usually, these are smaller or juvenile class fish that can be finicky and tricky to fool. Small live pilchards, sardines and other small white baits caught in a cast net or on a sabiki rig are top choices for the resident Tarpon in West Palm Beach. When the adults are around, 7-9� straight or paddle tailed soft plastic swimbaits are the top lure choice in West Palm Beach. The key to fooling the Tarpon in West Palm Beach is to present your lure right on the nose of a rolling fish. Often, when there are a lot around, you will see schools of adult Tarpon rolling in groups. Cast in front of the first one in the pack, if it does not show any interest continue to the next one. Usually, one of the fish will be fooled and you will get a reaction thump.",Tackle for Tarpon Fishing in West Palm Beach,"You will need some quality and heavy tackle for Tarpon fishing in West Palm Beach. Exactly what type of setup you choose will depend largely on where you will be targeting the Tarpon and your preferred technique. Anglers fishing on the beach and at the inlet from shore in West Palm Beach prefer a 9-11� rod for casting heavy lures long distances to reach the rolling fish. Boat anglers typically prefer a stout 7-8� rod so it can be easily maneuvered around the boat, cast freely and to provide the maximum amount of leverage while fighting the fish. Anglers fishing on the bridges in West Palm Beach tend to fish lighter tackle where a lighter action 7-8� rod is preferred because of the light leader, small bait and small hooks necessary to get a bite. Reels that are used for Tarpon fishing in West Palm Beach range from an 4000-14000 sizes. 4000-5000 sized reels for inshore light tackle and 8000 sized reels and up for the big ones. Tarpon are extremely hard fighters and the adults grow to be over 200 pounds in West Palm Beach, so having a reel that operates with smooth drag under a heavy load, has a lot of torque and plenty of line capacity and great cranking power is essential for landing big Tarpon.",Locating Tarpon in West Palm Beach,"The biggest factor when locating Tarpon is the tides. They are an extremely predictable species with how they move about with the tide. As the tide goes out, the Tarpon will position farther out the inlet feeding on the baitfish flowing with the current. On the incoming tide, they will be found farther inshore as the baitfish flows in. The Tarpon know that the schools of baitfish drift around with the current and position themselves in the best spot to ambush it as it flows through. As the tide rises, look for them to be on the inshore bridges, river mouths, boat docks and channels. The biggest tip for locating Tarpon is to spot them rolling. Tarpon gulp oxygen so you will see them actively rolling their body on the surface as they feed and move around. Spotting Tarpon rolling on the surface is the best way to confirm you are in the right area to hook up.","Is it legal to catch Tarpon in West Palm Beach, Florida?","It is legal to catch Tarpon in West Palm Beach, but you must not remove them from the water. It is illegal to remove a Tarpon measuring 40"" or greater from the water. ",Where can I fish for Tarpon in West Palm Beach?,"You can catch Tarpon in the inlet in West Palm Beach, on the bridges, in the ICW and the spillways. ",What is the best way to catch Tarpon?,A large live mullet free lined in the area where Tarpon are feeding is the absolute best way to catch one,What is the best lure for Tarpon?,The best lure for Tarpon is a straight tail soft plastic lure. They mimick a large mullet and have action the Tarpon just cannot resist!,Are Tarpon hard to catch?,"Tarpon are one of the most challenging species of fish in West Palm Beach to catch. Locating and hooking them is usually the easy part, but landing and safely releasing these giant, prehestoric fish is extremely difficult. ",Does West Palm Beach have Tarpon all year around?,"Yes, we have resident Tarpon that live both in the inlet and around the bridges in West Palm Beach. They are plentiful all year round and are much larger on average that most of the resident Tarpon found in the surrounding area. ",What is the best time to catch Tarpon in West Palm Beach?,The best time to catch Tarpon is going to be during the fall Mullet run as the Tarpon are also migrating with their forage. Tarpon can be caught year round and make second migration during the spring as well.,Fighting and Landing Tarpon in West Palm Beach,"Fighting Tarpon and landing them successfully in West Palm Beach involves a ton of technique. We have a few pointers learned through years of trial and error in West Palm Beach that will help you perfect your Tarpon fighting and landing techniques. The first is to fish with a very tight drag. Not so tight that you will instantly break off, but you want to minimize drag slip when jamming that hook set. Tarpon�s mouths are almost entirely bone so there really are only two places to hook them, right in the corner or in the �button,� which is a soft spot in the roof of their mouth. That�s why you need to ensure a positive hookset. It is not uncommon for anglers in West Palm Beach to set the hook multiple times after getting a bite. When the Tarpon jumps, point your rod tip straight at the fish to avoid pulling hooks. Once the Tarpon is on, get the fish in as quickly as possible to avoid fighting the Tarpon to exhaustion. In West Palm Beach, you need to put some serious muscle to these fish, pumping the rod up without high sticking, then taking in as much line as possible. Anglers in West Palm Beach say you must �break the spirit� of the Tarpon to land it quickly and ensure a healthy release. Landing Tarpon in West Palm Beach is a game of angles. The fish want to swim in the path of least resistance, so you want to position yourself ahead of the fish if he is heading toward structure to turn the fish. When landing Tarpon from shore in West Palm Beach, it is best to get yourself behind the fish in the water, and guide it to shore, this is where many anglers in West Palm Beach want to grab the leader which gives the fish a ton of leverage and allows them to easily break the line or throw the hook.

First is Blueline Tilefish also known as Grey Tiles and live in waters from 200�-600�. The second type of Tilefish you will find is the Golden Tilefish. They will be in waters from 700� and deeper. Regardless of which type of Tilefish you are targeting; the fishing technique is the same. Golden Tilefish can be caught and harvested year-round with a bag limit of 1 per angler. Blueline Tilefish can be caught year-round in West Palm Beach but have closed season but have a limit of 3 per angler.,Setups and Tips for Tilefish in West Palm Beach,"Regardless of which type of Tilefish you are targeting in West Palm Beach, you will be fishing in deep water. These deeper waters are close to, and at times, within the Gulf Stream where there is a strong current. Because of this, you will be using weights ranging from 3lbs to 12lbs when fishing for Tilefish in West Palm Beach. The lead alone can quickly fatigue an angler when reeling in from the depths and that is why you want to use an electric reel. The current not only requires you to use heavy weights when deep dropping but causes your line to scope out (where the line bows) and using the smallest diameter line possible is a necessity when fishing for Tilefish in West Palm Beach. Your baits must stay on the bottom as Tilefish will not venture far from the bottom and their burrow.",Locating Tilefish in West Palm Beach,"Tilefish live on the bottom and create burrows in the mud in West Palm Beach. If you have a sounder powerful enough to ping the ocean floor, you can look at the return to determine whether it is soft or hard bottom, but it can still be difficult to distinguish mud from sand. Another way to look for spots to fish for Tilefish in West Palm Beach is by looking at the contour lines on charts. Look for contour lines that are spaced for apart and have a pronounced �U� shaped curved in them. Many times, this will be muddy bottom and will hold Tilefish in West Palm Beach.",Where can I find Golden Tilefish in West Palm Beach?,You can find Golden Tilefish hanging around a common depth range of 500-900' off West Palm Beach. They live in areas of soft bottom like mud or clay which they borrow their bodies into for protection. ,Where can I find Blue Line Tilefish in West Palm Beach ,"Blue Line Tilefish live in shallower water than the Goldens. The 200-400' depth range is where you need to be for the Blue Lines. They like hard, or live bottom and they are known to be much more prevalent than Goldens. ",Do Tilefish have high mercury content in West Palm Beach?,"The Tilefish in West Palm Beach do have a high Mercury Content, but they are safe to eat. They do not contain as much Mercury as the Tilefish found in the Gulf, which are known for having a much higher Mercury content. ",Can I Hand Crank For Tilefish in West Palm Beach?,"You can hand crank for the Tilefish in West Palm Beach, but deep dropping with an electric reel is much more preferred. Hand cranking for Tilefish is extremely exhausting and can take some of the fun out of catching this delicious species.",What else will I catch while targeting Tilefish in West Palm Beach?,"Mainly you will find Rose Bellies, Vermillion Snapper and some groupers",What is the size limit for Tilefish in West Palm Beach?,There is no size limit on Golden Tilefish and each angler may keep one with a max total of 3 per boat,What is the best bait for Tilefish in West Palm Beach?,Squid is the best bait as it lat longer than cut bait and has much more movement that cut bait. Squid is also the normal forage of tilefish.,Making Your Own Tilefish Rigs,"Making your own Tilefish Rigs is an easy way to cut down on the costs and hassle of purchasing pre tied rigs every time you want to target Tilefish. Make yourself up an organized tackle box including 80 lb. line to tie the rig, 3 way swivels, 6/0-8/0 non-stainless circle hooks 4-6 lb. sinkers and water activated deep drop lights. In essence, a Tilefish rig is nothing more than a giant sabiki rig. Use the 3 way swivels to make the branches of your Tilefish rig with the hooks hanging 6 inches off the rig. 6-8 branches is all you need. Space the swivels about 3 feet apart, leaving room for your weight on the bottom, and a snap or barrel swivel on the top to connect your main line to. ",,

Many years ago, the snook population took a hard hit from red tide and overfishing and became a protected species by the FWC. Only snook caught �in the slot�, meaning over a minimum size but nit larger than size, can be kept. Because of this, the snook in West Palm Beach can be huge as the larger ones are protected from harvesting. These snook are powerful fish and you need to have the proper tackle to handle them. Snook are opportunistic predators and either wait to ambush prey in covered areas or move as schools looking for an easy meal in West Palm Beach. Snook also see a tremendous amount of pressure from anglers in West Palm Beach, so your presentation must be on point to be successful.","Setups, Rigs and Lures for Snook in West Palm Beach","Since the snook can often be larger than 40� in West Palm Beach, you are going to want a heavier setup that has the backbone and stopping power to match them. A medium heavy rod with a fast action is a good start when targeting snook. Pair that with a 6000-8000 class spinning reel so that you have the line capacity and drag you will need to get that snook to the boat in West Palm Beach. Lures vary depending on the area that you are fishing but there are a few lures that are essential in any snook anglers tackle box. A topwater plug that you impart a �walk the dog� action too is a proven slayer and can be used everywhere from the surf to the backwaters. Another favorite of snook anglers in West Palm Beach is the flair hawk style jig. These jigs have crimped hair and a tail to give it a larger profile when bounced along the bottom. Live bait is always a favorite of an angler but make sure you are using the smallest hooks you feel comfortable fishing to improve the presentation. ",Where to Find Snook in West Palm Beach,"One of the great things about Snook In West Palm Beach is they can be found throughout our waters. You will find them cruising in schools along the beach and are easily targeting by surf anglers. Make sure to get your bait or lure out in front of the school. Snook are prolific around piers as this provides a natural habitat for small baitfish and gives the snook in West Palm Beach areas to lie in wait of an easy meal. Snook love cover and is why you will also find them along the mangroves in the backwater where baitfish take refuge. Docks are another great place to find snook in West Palm Beach and many docks also have green underwater lights called �snook lights�. Finally, when the sun is down, snook will stack up in the shadows of bridges using the lighted areas to targeting unsuspecting baitfish.",What tide is best for Snook Fishing?,The best tide for Snook Fishing is outgoing because the water is usually dirtier and the fish are fooled more easily by your lure or baitfish,What is the best lure to catch Snook?,The best lure to catch Snook is a 1.5 oz Flair Hawk jig,Can you Keep Snook in Florida?,You can keep 1 snook per day ranging between 28-32 inches from september 1-december 15,Do I need A Snook Permit in Florida?,"You do need a Snook Permit in Florida, it is $10 per year.",Can I catch Snook at the Palm Beach Inlet?,"The Palm Beach Inlet is one of the best locations to catch Snook in all of Florida. Whether you are fishing by boat or from the rocks, it is a world famous location for catching Snook.",Why do I keep getting short strikes while Snook Fishing?,"Snook school up thick along the bottom, called ""pods"". Often times anglers getting short strikes from Snook are really bouncing their lure through a pod. Your lure is running over the backs and the tails of all the Snook, but is not running across their nose. Often times switching up your angle on the fish to sweep across their faces will result in getting bites",Do I need heavy tackle for Snook Fishing?,"You need heavy tackle for catching the Snook in West Palm Beach. Especially when fishing tight to structure, you really want a setup that can turn the fish and keep them away from the structure. In the Inlet, you need an extra strong rod to pull the fish up through the rocks and keep them from diving under the rocks while trying to get them in. ",Snook Season in West Palm Beach ,"Snook season in West Palm Beach is a year-round fishery. You can only keep them when they are ""in season"" from September 1-Dec 15, but you can target them for catch and release year-round. In the summer, the Snook spawn along the beaches and are caught best in the surf, around the piers and in the inlets. Come September, the Snook begin moving back to the bridges while they wait for the mullet to show up. Once the mullet run is on you will find Snook gorging on their favorite baitfish anywhere they can be found. After the mullet fade away, the water and air temperatures begin to drop and the Snook are stacked in the back water, the shrimp flush begins. This is the best time of year to fish the bridges in West Palm Beach as the Snook are stacked up on the shadow lines feeding on shrimp. ",,

They are notoriously hard fighters for their size and are caught right off the beach in the surf zone at West Palm Beach. The Pompano in West Palm Beach are primarily bottom feeders that mainly eat crustaceans like sand fleas, shrimp, and crabs. Pompano are a migratory species that swim south in the winter and north when that water begins heating back up in the spring. Finding a lot of Pompano in West Palm Beach is all about water temperature. The Pompano are most comfortable when the water is around 68 degrees, so they follow that water temperature up and down the coast. November through January is the best time to catch Pompano in West Palm Beach. Look for them to be right in the surf feeding on crustaceans behind the rolling waves. As waves break, the sand along the bottom gets churned up, uncovering hundreds of sand fleas for the Pompano to feast on.

",Locating Pompano in West Palm Beach,"Before filling your cooler with Pompano, you will first have to find where they are in West Palm Beach. They can be found in the surf, off the ocean piers and sometimes even around the inshore waters of West Palm Beach. Pompano are a favorite for land-based anglers in West Palm Beach because they run so close to shore within an easy cast from the beach. The best part about them is that they are spread all up and down the surf zone so you can find a nice, empty spot on the beach to get set up and have just as good a shot as the next guy. No need to fight the crowds when locating Pompano in West Palm Beach. In fact, you have a better chance fishing in solitude. Ideal water conditions for locating Pompano in West Palm Beach include a medium, slightly swelling surf, just enough to mix up the sand fleas along the bottom. When the water is too rough and churned up, the Pompano tend to move farther out into cleaner water. The most important tip for locating Pompano is to look for something different. Whether it is a deeper hole or cut through a sandbar, rip current or white water churning up bait, the Pompano strongly relate to the beach structure in West Palm Beach.

",Natural vs. Artifical Baits for Pompano Fishing,"There are pros and cons to using both natural and artifical baits for Pompano fishing.

It is always best to give the fish whatever they may be naturally feeding on so natural baits always will work well. However, natural baits like sand fleas do not always stay on the hook well. If the bite is good, you will constantly be re baiting hooks, catching more bait and dealing with constant stolen baits off your hook. Artificial baits like fish bites stay on the hook extremely well. It is scented too is very effective for catching fish. You do not need to re bait every time you get a bite or catch a fish so it is a lot more efficient and simple too. Many anglers in West Palm Beach will double up, using a piece of artificial Pompano bait first, followed by some natural bait. This way, there is still something there for the fish to bite if they steal your bait. Another way to catch Pompano, commonly used by boat and pier anglers is the jig. Pompano jigs are extremely effective as well as the most effecient way of catching pomano. The quills on the hooks along with the action of the jig is plenty to attract the fish. ",,

However, there are a few things we always like to start with on the nearshore waters. First, is a casting jig like a Shimano ColtSniper or a Got-Cha Jigfish. Whip one of these jigs out as far as you can and skip it back on the surface. These jigs work extremely well as a searchbait and are great for covering water and locating some active fish when you first set up to fish the nearshore zone in West Palm Beach.",charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach,"Before we dive into nearshore fishing in West Palm Beach, it is important to know what is considered nearshore fishing. Since a significant portion of our fishery is relatively close to shore compared to any other location of the eastern United States, the term �nearshore� is relative to West Palm Beach. When speaking to other anglers and you hear the term �nearshore fishing�, this will for the most part be from 80� of water and shallower. The nearshore waters have all sorts of great habitat for the local fish population. There are manmade reefs, natural reefs and live bottom that creates a safe haven for baitfish and hunting grounds for predatory fish in West Palm Beach.",Types of Fish you will Catch Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach," Ready for some great news� while there are certain species that anglers target when nearshore fishing in West Palm Beach, there is a chance that you will catch any of the pelagics and bottom dwelling species. This does not include those bottom dwelling species that normally reside in depths of 300�+. The species that are most targeted in West Palm Beach are Snapper, Porgies and Mackerel. Snook and Tarpon are also targeting during the fall mullet by boat close to the beach. While these are the targets of local anglers, regularly Dolphin  and Wahoo are caught while nearshore fishing in West Palm Beach.",How to Catch Fish While Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach ,"There are two fishing techniques you will be using while nearshore fishing in West Palm Beach. The first one is trolling. Trolling is quite different nearshore compared to offshore fishing in West Palm Beach. When trolling nearshore, you will not have 6-8 lines out. You will most likely have 2-4 lines out. You will also use lighter tackle than your offshore setups. When trolling lures for inshore species, slow your speed down and only bump up the speed if you are not getting bites. Many inshore species are opportunistic feeders and will not chase baits like offshore species. The next technique you will use and the most popular, is bottom fishing the nearshore waters in West Palm Beach. Bottom fishing can be either drifting baits along the bottom or can be anchoring up current from your target location.",What is Nearshore Fishing?,"The ""Nearshore Zone"" here in West Palm Beach includes anywhere from just past the surf break to out just a short distance. Nearshore fishing is always in clear sight of land. We consider anglers fishing towards the surf in their boat to be inshore fishing, but anglers trolling just beyond the break to be fishing ""Nearshore""",Can I catch Pelagic Species while Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"One of the best features about West Palm Beach is that we get such nice gulf stream water so close to shore. For that reason, many nearshore anglers in West Palm Beach regurlarly report catches of Dolphin (Mahi Mahi), Sailfish, Cobia, Wahoo and Kingfish while nearshore fishing in West Palm Beach",What should I look for while nearshore fishing in West Palm Beach?,"Look for things like rock piles, artifical reefs on the bottom, temperature breaks or color changes, bait or fish on the surface. The fluxuating nearshore waters will determine what species are around and what you should be looking for. After entering the nearshore zone in West Palm Beach, take note of the water quality and signs of life in the area to help determine what species could be around and the best technique for targetting them.",Why go Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"Nearshore fishing is a favorite for anglers in West Palm Beach. Why? Because you can get to the fishing grounds so quickly and catch some delicious and some extremely unique species of fish. You don't burn much fuel in a day of nearshore fishing and you can really load up the box with delicious Snapper, Grouper, Cobia, Mackerel and even some pelagic species if you pick the right day!",What is the difference between nearshore and offshore fishing?,"Nearshore fishing is generally considered to be very close to shore. In West Palm Beach, we consider nearshore fishing to be from right past the surf break to about 3 miles offshore. The nearshore zone in West Palm Beach is much smaller than many other areas along the east coast because the Gulf Stream waters push so close to shore here that anything past 3 miles from shore is considered offshore or deep sea fishing for pelagic species. ",What should I do if I am not catching fish Nearshore in West Palm Beach?,"Move! If you are fishing nearshore in West Palm Beach and are not finding any bites, simply move your boat to a new location. Usually you don�t need to move far. Many anglers will do a short drift for about 10-15 minuites while live chumming to see if they can build a bite. If nothing happens after a short drift, move the boat around to some new or better looking water, or to where you find some marks on your fish finder screen. ",What else will I encounter while Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"Many anglers will fish in the Nearshore Zone in West Palm Beach to catch their live baits. Whether you are using a sabiki rig or a cast net, the nearshore waters in West Palm Beach hold plenty of baitfish so many anglers use this zone as a quick pit stop on their way to deeper water to stop and catch their live baits for the day.",Tips for Nearshore Fishing in West Palm Beach,"There is a lot for anglers to consider while nearshore fishing. Things like tidal outflows, gulf stream currents, color or temperature changes and beach topography. Many factors come into play when nearshore fishing that may not have as much of an impact on offshore and inshore angling as it does for nearshore anglers. The tide outflow from the bays and nearby waterways are an extreme influencer on the nearshore waters. Outgoing tides pull nutrient rich inshore water out into the nearshore zone, where the water quality is always fluxuating. When inshore outflows meet with ocean currents, distinct color changes form that many predatory fish will use as a tool for feeding. On the other hand, offshore and gulf stream currents can push fantastic, clean water into the nearshore zone in West Palm Beach. This can cause large temperature breaks that will draw pelagic species close to shore and into the nearshore zone. Nearshore waters can be one of the most productive zones to fish in West Palm Beach because of the constant exchange of inshore and offshore waters accompanied by the mix of inshore and offshore species.

First you have what are considered reef fish like parrot fish, angel fish and unicorn fish. Alongside of them you will find Snapper (Mangrove), Schoolmaster Snapper, Triggerfish and Snapper (Yellowtail). Then you have the fish that prowl the reefs in West Palm Beach like Barracuda, Spanish Mackerel, King Mackerel (Kingfish) and sharks. Depending on the time of year, there are grouper, cobia and Snapper (Cubera) that frequent the reefs in West Palm Beach as well. While these are some of the fish that frequent the reef system, you will also find a stray Dolphin (Mahi Mahi) or Sailfish chasing bait around the reefs in West Palm Beach.",How to fish the Reef in West Palm Beach,"When reef fishing in West Palm Beach, you will either be drift fishing or anchored up on a spot you think is holding fish. Drift fishing is best when you have reefs that do not have a high profile to reduce your chance of snags. Before you put your lines out to drift the reef in West Palm Beach, take a min to know how your boat will be drifting with the current and wind. If you do not get a bite on the first drift, start your drift just outside the original position and always mark when you get a bite to really dial in your drift line on the reef in West Palm Beach. For high relief reefs, watch your bottom finder and mark the spot that you think is holding fish. Get up current of the spot you marked on the reef and drop anchor. When you are anchored up in West Palm Beach, you want to be 20�-50� away from the mark if using a chum line and be on the down current side if you are dropping lines directly to the bottom.

This is a great general rule of thumb to follow when deciding what lure to use while inshore fishing in West Palm Beach. Because of how heavily pressured these fish are, they are often times fairly tricky to fool and you must present the perfect lure to these fish to get a bite.

However, inshore fishing is excellent and does not see much pressure compared to other areas in south Florida. Inshore fishing is considered any waters that are inside of the inlet. This includes the ICW, backwaters and canal systems around West Palm Beach. There are numerous ways to inshore fish in West Palm Beach whether it be from shore, small boats and kayaks. If you are fishing inshore form a boat, make sure you understand the waters and tides you will be in as it is easy to get stranded during tide changes.",What type of fish will I catch when Inshore Fishing in West Palm Beach?,"There are all sorts of fish that live and cruise through the inshore waters of West Palm Beach. Anglers mainly target a few different species like Snook, Tarpon, Snapper , Trout and Redfish. While these are the main targets of inshore anglers in West Palm Beach, some other less targeted species are Moonfish (Lookdown Fish), Snapper, Spanish and Jacks. Some of these species can get extremely large and you will need a heavy setup if you want to have a chance at landing them in West Palm Beach. Other species you may find along the way when inshore fishing are sharks, rays and catfish.",Targeting fish while Inshore Fishing in West Palm Beach,"There are two main ways you will be inshore fishing in West Palm Beach. First is by water whether that be from a boat or a kayak. When inshore fishing in West Palm Beach form water, you want to find areas that will hold bait. These areas can be pilings, oyster cars, mangroves or any inshore structure that could protect baitfish from predators. Predatory fish frequent these same areas waiting for bait to be pushed around by the tides or they will push the schools of bait to an area that is easy for them to pick them off. For anglers inshore fishing from land in West Palm Beach, you also want to look for areas that provide shelter for baitfish. Fishing around docks, pilings and shoreline with mangroves will give you the best chance at getting tight in West Palm Beach.",What is considered inshore fishing?,"Inshore Fishing in West Palm Beach includes the surf zone, inlets, and backwaters of West Palm Beach. In other areas, 1-3 miles from shore can also be considered inshore but in West Palm Beach, we limit Inshore fishing to the surf and backwaters because the Gulf Stream Current, where anglers regularly catch pelagic species, pushes in so close to shore here. Inshore anglers target species like Snook, Snapper, Tarpon and Jack Crevalle which regularly cruise in the surf zone, inlets and backwaters of West Palm Beach",Where can I inshore fish in saltwater in West Palm Beach?,"The best places for inshore saltwater fishing in West Palm Beach is along the beach, in the inlet and in the backwater on the bridges and around the islands and ICW in West Palm Beach.","What is the best inshore fishing in West Palm Beach, Florida?","The best inshore fishing in West Palm beach depenends on the time of year and what baitfish are running. During the Mullet Run, the beach and inlet are the places to be. Once that�s over and the shrimp flush begins, the best inshore fishing in West Palm Beach will be on the bridges where the fish will be stacked up ambushing shrimp. In the summer, the Snook are spawning along the beach and in the inlet so this is where the best inshore fishing for all species will take place in the summer, as many other species of fish are hanging right around those spawning Snook.",What fish are biting inshore in West Palm Beach?,"There is a long list of species that you will catch while inshore fishing in West Palm Beach. The most popluar species to catch in West Palm Beach are Snook and Snapper. Mangrove, Mutton, and Lane Snapper are all extremely prevalent in the inshore waters of West Palm Beach. Tarpon, Jack Crevalle, Bluefish, Ladyfish, Spanish Mackerel, King Mackerel, Bonefish, Pompano, Blue Runner, Cubera Snapper, Goliath Grouper, and Sharks are a few more species you can run into while inshore fishing in West Palm Beach.",What will I catch fishing at the Palm Beach Inlet?,"The Lake Worth Inlet in West Palm Beach is home to just about all of the Inshore Species you can catch here in West Palm Beach at different points in the season. Anglers who frequent the inlet often catch Snook, Snapper (Mangrove), Snapper (Mutton), Tarpon, Jack Crevalle, Bluefish, Ladyfish, and Spanish Mackerel. ",Inshore Fishing with Lures vs. Live Bait?,"Inshore fishing with lures and with live bait are two completely different techniques that are both productive at different times. When the fish are finicky, live bait is always the way to go. However, if the fish are more spread out, or they are biting well, artifical lures are the way to go. Although fish love eating live baits, usually anglers fishing them are stationary or stuck in one small area, while anglers using lures can cover a lot more water very quickly to find the productive zone where the fish are and then fish that area hard. Remember that 10% of the water holds 90% of the fish so finding that productive zone and continuously sweeping your lure through it can often times be a lot more productive than soaking a live bait and waiting for those fish to come to you. ",Where is an inshore tackle and bait store in West Palm Beach?,"Fishin My Best Life Bait and Tackle is the top rated inshore store for all inshore lures, baits, rods, reels and expert advice",Inshore fishing by boat vs. on foot?,"You can target all of the Inshore species caught around the inshore waters of West Palm Beach both by boat or by shore on foot. Both have their pros and cons and both can be extremely productive. Fishing from a boat, however, is almost always more productive than fishing on foot. Being on a boat allows you to access more areas, fish from different and better angles (under bridges) and land fish much easier than when on foot. However, fishing from shore allows you to cover more water in a quicker amount of time, and you get a different prespective on the water. When standing on shore, usually you are elevated high off the water so you can see what is going on much better. On the boat, you have to set anchor to effectively fish an area while on foot you can quickly bounce around spot to spot or fish a different section of the structre if you are not getting bites without having to pull your anchor and reset.

Finally, if you find where the Bonita are feeding, there is a good chance that there are Tuna (Skipjack) mixed in with them in West Palm Beach. The Tuna (Skipjack) will many times hit the smaller baits of the larger ones in your spread compared to the Bonita. ",Tips for catching Tuna (Skipjack) in West Palm Beach,"When you are targeting Tuna (Skipjack) by chasing tuna birds in West Palm Beach, it can be impossible sometimes to get a head of the school and get trolling baits out. The best way to get into the school of Tuna (Skipjack) is to have a white bucktail jig on a pitch rod and run your boat ahead of where you think they are going and then throw the bucktail in front of them and reel in quickly. If you find them busting on the surface in West Palm Beach, get your trolling spread out and cruise the edges of where they are. Do not run over the school of Tuna (Skipjack) or they will go deep and move on to a new area. Finally, if you are looking for Tuna (Skipjack) amongst the Bonita in West Palm Beach, know that you will have to deal with catching Bonita as well. Put out the smallest lure you have in your box as this will be the one that they will bite and bump up your trolling speed.",What pound test line is used for Tuna (Skipjack) fishing in West Palm Beach?,"30 Pound line test, either monofilament or braided line, with a fluorcarbon leader is perfect for Tuna (Skipjack)",What is the best lure for Tuna (Skipjack) in West Palm Beach?,The best lure for Tuna (Skipjack) is a surface popper.

However, Skipjacks can be caugh all year round. ",Do I have to bleed Skipjack Tuna?,"Yes. Tuna require some prep work before icing to help keep the meat the best it can be for the table. Use a serrated blade knife to remove the gills of the tuna, then make a small slice directly behind the pectoral fin on the side of the Tuna to bleed it out. Removing the guts from the Tuna and stuffing the cavity with ice is reccomended but not always necessary. After making these incisions, place the fish in a bucket of salt water to let it bleed out and then bury the fish in ice once it is bled properly. A saltwater slush is reccomended for keeping Tuna the coldest. ",What should I look for while chasing Skipjack Tuna?,"Lowlight times of the day, slick calm seas, clusters of birds picking on the surface, bait balls on the surface, slicks, flying fish, other species of Tuna ",Are Tuna (Skipjack) edible? ,100% they are edible fish.

Often times, you can find them mixed right in with other species of Tuna. Lowlight conditions are best including first light, last light and overcast days. The Skipjack Tunas have incredible eyesight and feed best when there is contrast between the baitfish and the surface of the water. Choppy days are great for Tuna fishing, but these fish are easiest to find when the seas are slick calm. These conditions make it simple to spot clusters of birds picking on the surface, slicks, current breaks and bait pushed up against the surface.

Giving the fish more profile, action and meat to bite all increases you chances of catching bigger Wahoo. Another key to catching bigger Wahoo is to fish when its rough out. When the seas get sloppy is really the best time to catch a big Wahoo, especially when looking for that triple digit fish. When its rough the Wahoo tend to hold deeper in the water column so make sure your baits are getting down deep enough to the strike zone, especially when its rough. ",charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-jupiter-inshore-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-bottom-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-palm-beach-deep-sea-fishing|charter-fishing-boats-us-fl-boynton-beach-deep-sea-fishing,What to consider when targetting Wahoo in West Palm Beach,"There are a few main things that are extremely important to consider when looking for Wahoo in West Palm Beach. The first is structure, these fish love hanging around structure whether it be a steep ledge along the bottom, a wreck or floating debris. If you can locate something different about the area you are fishing, it should be holding some Wahoo. The next is water movement, which is one of the most essential aspects you must understand to become an effective Wahoo angler. Wahoo are known for holding on the down current side of structure, letting the current bring the baitfish to them. . The third thing to consider when hunting for Wahoo is the season. Wahoo can be caught year around in West Palm Beach, but the peak season is in July and August, especially around the full moons during these months. If you can line up at least two of these prime Wahoo conditions, you will find great Wahoo success in West Palm Beach.",Lures vs Bait for Wahoo Fishing in West Palm Beach,"Anglers in West Palm Beach typically fish for Wahoo with a combination of bait and lures. Some anglers prefer to use just lures or just bait for Wahoo, but we believe the best formula is a combination of both. Jet head skirted lures work great on their own because they have good action and the size profile these fish are looking for, but there is not much incentive for them to chase your bait going upwards of 25 MPH. The kicking tail of a baitfish behind your lure not only gives the fish some incentive to track, chase and eat your lure, but it also triggers a better reaction strike from the fish. They see a lure flying throught the water, being chased by another fish so they are triggered into competitive feeding mode, causing an extremely aggressive strike.",How the Moon Phase affects Wahoo Fishing in West Palm Beach,"Moon phase is one of the most intregal factors to consider when targetting Wahoo. The reason for this is because around the full and new moon phases, we experience a phenomenon known as ""King Tides"". During these tides in West Palm Beach, both high and low end swings increase meaning we have much higher and lower tides than usual. Accompanied by this is extreme water movement and flow. During the king tides, the water flows much quicker than average, causing baitfish to be pushed around more, and disorienting them as they are pushed over structures and bottom contour in West Palm Beach. The Wahoo use this to their advantage and stage on the down current side of the structure, waiting for disoriented baitfish to be pushed over the ledge. Keep in mind that these are not the only times you can catch Wahoo, but they certianly are the most productive!  ",Where do you catch Wahoo in West Palm Beach?,"Wahoo are caught off West Palm Beach in about 90'-300' feet of water. Ledges, bottom contours, floating debris or around structure are all prodcutive areas to find Wahoo in West Palm Beach. Zig Zag trolling patterns are used to cover ground and a variety of different depths where the Wahoo could be feeding. ",What is the best Wahoo Lure?,"The best Wahoo lure is one that creates a large bubble trail when trolled at high speeds. Wahoo exert a ton of energy swimming in quick bursts of speed to catch up to the baitfish they are attacking. They are known to be the fastest swimming fish in the ocean in short bursts and cannot sustain high speeds for very long. A lure that creates a large, long bubble trail through the water is great for Wahoo because it gives them some incentive to use up so much energy to chase that baitfish or lure. They have a split second to decide if they want to use up their energy to chase that bait or not, so make sure you are using a lure that gives the fish a little extra incentive to strike.",What is the best bait for Wahoo?,Ballyhoo and Bonita strips are the best bait for the Wahoo in West Palm Beach. It is always a good idea to rig your trolling lures intended for Wahoo with bait. Ballyhoo work well because the large profile gives the fish some meat to bite onto and it is a good attractor for some larger fish. Many Captains and Anglers prefer to rig their Wahoo lures with Bonita strips because they are tougher and do not wash out like ballyhoo do. Bonita strips also flutter more in the water when trolled and increase the chances for a reactionary bite.,What water temperature do Wahoo like?,"Wahoo prefer water temperatures between 72 and 80 degrees. They are occasianally caught in both colder and warmer water, but this range is where they thrive. ",Do Wahoo Jump?,"Wahoo are known to occasionally skyrocket out of the water, similar to King Mackerel (Kingfish). It is not common behavior for Wahoo, but they do skyrocket on lures run close to the surface or when attacking baits on the surface. ",What is the best moon phase for Wahoo Fishing?,"The best moon phase for Wahoo fishing in West Palm Beach is the full moon phase. This phase lasts about 4-6 days and includes a couple days leading up to the moon, the 100% full moon then a few days afterwards as well. The new moon has similar effects on water movement and tidal swings, but the full moon tides really gets the water and bait moving most. The July and August full moon phases tend to be the best moon phases of the year to target Wahoo in West palm Beach",What depth is best for Wahoo,"Wahoo will position themselves to best ambush disoriented baitfish depending on the tide. Usually, the Wahoo are reported to be biting around a specific depth range. Zig Zagging throughout this depth range can really help cover water and locate where these fish are holding. 90-300 feet is really the hot Wahoo zone off West Palm Beach and anglers can narrow this depth down even more depending on the tide, prevailing conditions and time of day. ",Wahoo fishing Tides and Time of Day in West Palm Beach,"Tides are an extemely important factor for targeting Wahoo in West Palm Beach. A good example of this is fishing along a steep ledge. On the incoming tide, the Wahoo will be located on the shallow side of the ledge, waiting to attact disoriented baitfish that are pushed over the wall. However, on the outgoing tide, the fish will be posted up on the deeper side. The Wahoo are more comfortable feeding in slightly deeper water, and there is a lot more bait being pushed around so the outgoing tide will always be better fishing. The best time of day to catch Wahoo is during the low light conditions of the day. Wahoo in West Palm Beach are primarily low light hunters. They have great eye sight and, like Tuna, tend to feed deeper in the column during the day. During low light conditions like first light, last light and on overcast days, the contrast between the baitfish and the surface of the water is increased making it easier for the Wahoo to key in on a baitfish during these times. Many anglers in West Palm Beach get out on the water early to target Wahoo for the short feeding window, then move on to targetting other species once the sun rises up a little higher in the sky. ",,

Once the summer doldrums begin kicking in, anglers in West Palm Beach start flocking to the piers. This is because the Snook spawn along the beaches and around the pier throughout the summer months. This the best time to catch those big breeders, they may not be too hungry, but are easily tempted with a large baitfish like a Sand Perch, Croaker or Ladyfish. The piers are like a hotel for the spawning Snook because there are not many places for them to hide along the beaches while they spawn. Not only that, but a variety of other great species are caught around the piers in West Palm Beach daily. Pompano, Spanish Mackerel, King Mackerel (Kingfish), Cobia and Sailfish are all",Species caught from the pier in West Palm Beach,"A huge variety of species are commonly caught from piers in West Palm Beach. The best thing about the piers in West Palm Beach is that the gulf stream water runs directly by the pier and up the beach so many species that are not commonly caught from shore can be found at the piers in West Palm Beach. Some of the species regularly caught by pier anglers in West Palm Beach are Snook, Tarpon, Jack Crevalle, Sharks, Spanish Mackerel, King Mackerel (Kingfish), Sailfish, Cobia, Bonita, Barracuda, Blue Runners, Ladyfish, Pompano, Snapper (Mangrove), Snapper (Mutton). Of course, different techniques can be applied to target individual species, but one of the great things about the piers in West Palm Beach is that you just never know what is going to come up next. When the wind is blowing heavily in the winter, you will see a few hardcore anglers sending live baits out on trolley rigs, kites and helium balloons from the piers in West Palm Beach for Sailfish. Many anglers pier fishing in West Palm Beach will always have a Snook jig or something similar ready for when that Cobia comes swimming by on a school of rays or a big shark.",Rigging up for Pier Fishing in West Palm Beach,"There are three main outfits you will find anglers using for pier fishing in West Palm Beach. First is a conventional bottom rod. You will need a stout 8 foot or longer conventional rod with a strong 15-25 sized reel for fishing larger live, dead, or cut baits on the bottom. You want a long rod so you can reach underneath the piers in West Palm Beach without rubbing your line. Guys catch a lot of big fish that run into the structure on the bottom so you really need a setup that can turn those fish and pull them up. You will also need an 8-9-foot spinning rod for lighter live, dead, and cut baits and for throwing jigs, swimbaits, spoons and top waters to Snook, Jack Crevalle, Tarpon, Bonita or whatever else decides to swim by the piers in West Palm Beach . Last, you will need a lightweight rod for your Sabiki rigs. Sabikis are one of the most popular method for catching bait on the pier in West Palm Beach. You want a rod you can beat up and not worry too much about for catching your baits at the pier in West Palm Beach, it does not need to be anything fancy for catching bait.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Heavier tackle is usually preferred for the larger predatory fish because they run for the bridge pilings and heavy structure along the bottom once hooked. You will need a stout rod with some backbone, no longer than 9� to turn these fish away from the structure in West Palm Beach. You will also need a lightweight, light action setup with light line and leader for fishing small baits and for when the fish are acting finicky. Sometimes, bumping down your leader to 10 or 15# fluorocarbon is the only way to get a bite on the bridge in West Palm Beach. For this style of fishing, you will need a light action rod with a fast tip and good backbone, and a strong 3000-5000 size reel with strong, smooth drag. 50-80# fluorocarbon leader is best when fishing larger live baits or artificial lures in West Palm Beach. Fluorocarbon leader is preferred by anglers� bridge fishing in West Palm Beach because of its abrasion resistance and its invisibility underwater. Having invisible leader is extremely important for fishing bridge shadow lines because the fish inspect your presentation as it drifts through the light. Depending on the day, they can be quick to deny a lure that is not perfectly presented into the shadow line.",Techniques for Bridge Fishing in West Palm Beach,"There are multiple different techniques anglers use when bridge fishing in West Palm Beach for a variety of species. Sweeping artificial lures like flair hawk jigs and paddle tail swimbaits along the bottom into the shadow line of the bridges in West Palm Beach is a great technique for getting thumped by a nice Snook. Some anglers prefer to fish the bridges in West Palm Beach with live bait. Anglers using live bait will typically fish larger live baits like mullet, sand perch or croakers on the bottom with a sliding egg sinker rig or right below the surface, free lined with no weight. When the Snook and Tarpon are keyed in on smaller baits on the bridges in West Palm Beach, let a free lined pilchard swim right on the edge of the shadow line. If you are after the Snapper (Mangrove) hiding under the bridges in West Palm Beach, try using a live or dead pilchard on a fish finder rig with a sliding egg sinker or a small pinch weight. If you just want to catch anything that is biting under the bridges in West Palm Beach, a 2 oz sliding egg sinker with 30# fluorocarbon leader and a 3/0 hook tipped with a live or dead pilchard or shrimp is a great technique.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High Speed Trolling requires that every piece of gear involved must be in perfect shape and ready for the strain that comes from the trolling, strike and fight. While you can high speed troll by yourself in West Palm Beach, it is recommended to have other anglers in the boat to help clear lines and with bringing in the fish when he strikes. The reason anglers High Speed Troll is for two reasons. First, you cover a tremendous amount of water increasing your chances of crossing a wahoo&rsquo;s path. Second, there is only one type fish you will catch high speed trolling in West Palm Beach and that is going to be Wahoo.</p>",What gear do I need to High Speed Trolling in West Palm Beach?,"There are many types of fishing that we talk about the ability to scale down your tackle if you want but High Speed Trolling in West Palm Beach is not one of them. If anything, go with heavier gear if there is any question at all if your current gear can handle it. For reels you want to have at minimum a 50 class convention reel spooled with minimum 65lb braid. Your rods should be a bent butt style rod with a minimum of 50-80 class weight. It is also highly recommended to tether your rods to the boat. The snap and barrel swivels you use need to be ball bearing as they are going to handle the spin when high speed trolling in West Palm Beach. The trolling rig is going to consist of a trolling weight in 16-48oz if pulling unweighted lures. Then you will need a minimum of 20� of 250lb or heavier monofilament leader. Finally, you will have your actual lure rigged with multi strand cable in a minimum of 300lb.",Angler Advisor Tips for High Speed Trolling in West Palm Beach,"Once you have all your gear ready and it is time to fish, High Speed Trolling in West Palm Beach is relatively easy but there are some key points you need to know and pay attention to before putting out your lines. Check everything� this means every knot, every swivel, the shock leader for any fray, the eyes of your rod for any knicks, cable on the lure for fray, drag settings and reel seat. If one part of your setup is in disrepair, you will lose the wahoo, most likely on strike. Wahoo swim at speeds approaching 50 miles an hour and they strike violently. Mix up your speed as you zig zag between 90�-280�. Start around 15 knots and steadily increase your speed if you are no getting bites. A good trolling speed range is between 15-20 knots. Finally, remember that there is a lot of weight from the lure and trolling weight, so when you get a wahoo on high speed trolling in West Palm Beach, keep that boat moving at a brisk pace. If you stop or go too slow, the weight will drop and change the angler the hook is being pulled and could result in the hook being shook from the Wahoo�s mouth. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

You want a rod that is at minimum 7�2� and has a moderate fast or slower action. This rod will allow you to cast baits farther as you will not only have the length you need but the slower action will give you some extra flex to really whip that lure or bait out there. You also want to have a heavy enough line that has the abrasion resistance you need as there are all sorts of rocks that can sever your line when surf fishing in West Palm Beach. For a reel you are going to want to use a spinning reel for it ease of use and in the size range of 5000-8000 depending on your rod selection for surf fishing in West Palm Beach. ,Targeting fish when Surf Fishing in West Palm Beach,"How you target fish when Surf Fishing in West Palm Beach depends on the species you are wanting to catch that day. For example, if you are targeting snook while surf fishing, you are going to want to get the bait ahead of the school as they move along the beach. Do not just throw your bait into the middle of the school as this can spook them causing them to move to a new area. The same tactic applies to tarpon while surf fishing in West Palm Beach as well. Large Jack Crevalle also cruise the beaches but are not as easily spooked and you can toss a lure or bait right into the middle of the school. If you are pompano fishing in West Palm Beach, you want to just allow your bait to soak in the water while watching your rod tip for the bite. Since all pompano rigs have circle hooks, once the fish takes the bait, the hook will set itself. ",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Deep Dropping is fishing with electric reels with heavy weights fishing depths from 300� to over 1000�. Not only will you catch some of the most delicious fish in the ocean while deep dropping in West Palm Beach. Deep Dropping is also a very relaxing style of fishing and can be enjoyed by both experienced and novice anglers. Fish that live and feed at these depths are mostly feeding squid and is why the is the preferred bait. The rig that are used for deep dropping, have components to them that help in mimicking squid in West Palm Beach.",Setup for Deep Dropping in West Palm Beach,"There are a lot of parts of your setup that you need to pay attention to and understand before deep dropping in West Palm Beach. When deep dropping, you are fishing in very deep water so you will have lots of line out and have a significant amount of weight on to handle the depth and current. The diameter of your line is important as you will have scope from the current so you will want to use no larger than 50lb braided line. Since you have so much line and weight out, you will want to use an electric reel that can handle the stress of the weight and fish when deep dropping in West Palm Beach. While you can hand crank up lines, you will quickly fatigue. There is also a tremendous strain on your rod from the hanging weight and fish so you will need a bent butt rod to handle it. The bent butt rod also helps you detecting a bite. ",Rigs and Tips for Deep Dropping in West Palm Beach,"While deep dropping in West Palm Beach is a fairly easy style off fishing, understanding your rigs, the bite and the bottom will significantly increase your chances of getting tight. Most the fish you catch deep dropping do not make �runs� on you, instead they are trying to swim back to the sea floor. Your rigs need to handle the strain of the fighting fish and weight. Using 200lb-300lb mono is not uncommon to support all of this weight and strain when deep dropping in West Palm Beach. Your hooks also need to be solid. Use at least a 2x gauge hook or you risk the chance of straightening the hook on retrieval. One of the most important things is to know when you are on the bottom as many of these fish will not stray far from it. When targeting Golden Tilefish for example in West Palm Beach, you will be fishing in muddy bottom. When you let your weight out and you think you hit bottom, you will know as the weight will briefly stick in the mud and slightly pull your rod tip down before it releases and the rod tip will bounce.

Using fishing reports before going fishing in West Palm Beach can tell you what species are currently biting and at what depth. If you're not sure what species of fish are biting, where to take your boat to catch them, and even if you already have a plan in mind, fishing reports can validate your plan or help you determine good back up plans. Good fishing reports will detail the type of tackle used like rod/reel, lure or bait used, type of line and presentation of the bait or lure.",Offshore Fishing Reports West Palm Beach,"Offshore Fishing Reports are especially valuable for anglers who are fishing the offshore humps and ledges in West Palm Beach. What fish are biting in West Palm Beach? The fish often tend to congregate around a certain depth. Knowing how far out the fish are can elimate a lot of the guess work, and fuel burned while driving around looking for life. Offshore fishing reports help anglers expand their skillset in West Palm Beach and can inform you about new kinds of fishing you dont normally do and may be good right now. Knowing what is biting is half the battle of going out and catching that particlar fish, even just having the knowlege of what is currently out there helps in developing a better plan. ",Inshore fishing reports West Palm Beach,"Inshore fishing reports are extremely helpful cutting down on wasted time on the water. Inshore fishing is all about developing patterns in West Palm Beach. If you are not keyed in to the current tides and fish patterns, it can be extremely difficult to maximize your time spent on the water. The fish in West Palm Beach usually feed for a certian phase of the tide so knowing when the bite is going to take place will greatly affect your catch ratio. Look for information like location, tide phase, water clarity and moon phase in your inshore fishing reports to help dial in on the feeding window and spend more time fishing when they are biting. ",What fish are biting in West Palm Beach,"Right now in August, Wahoo, Mahi, kingfish and blackfin are biting offshore. Snapper, snook, tarpon, jack crevalle and spanish mackerel are biting inshore in West Palm Beach. ",What is the latest fishing report ,The latest fishing reports can be found at FishinMyBestLife.com,Where do fishing reports come from?,"Fishing reports come from a combination of reliable sources including local guides and anglers who spend lots of time on the water, know what to look for as well as what information is valuable to report back.  ",How can I use fishing reports to improve my catch,"Fishing reports are a great value to anglers looking to imrove their catch. Not only do they provide valuable information like location or depth as well as what species are biting and on which tide, they�ll help you as an angler spend more time catching fish, and less time burning fuel and wasting time. ",What is the best month to fish in Florida?,"In West Palm Beach the best month to fish is August as the winds are low, there are a variety of fish biting and most fish are relatively close to shore",What fish can you catch from shore in Florida?,"There are all sorts of fish you can catch from shore in West Palm Beach but the top targets are Snook, Tarpon and Pompano",What types of fishing do your fishing reports cover?,We have contributing anglers and captains for a all types of fishing from inshore to offshore to boaters to kayakers to land based,Beach Fishing Reports,"Location, bait present and time of day are the most important things to look for on Beach Fishing Reports in West Palm Beach.  What fish can you catch from shore in Florida? Throughout the season, different baitfish migrate up and down the beach trough. They are so plentiful that the fish don�t really waste their time chasing them. For that reason, it is important to know which stretch of beach has fish vs which stretches have just bait. Many anglers who see a huge pod of bait tight to the beach get excited and assume there must be predators lurking nearby in West Palm Beach. This is not always the case, as the fish could be miles down the beach, waiting to intercept the next bait pod that comes through. Use beach fishing reports to determine which beaches have the fish, so you can go right there and greater your chances of catching them on the feed.",,
